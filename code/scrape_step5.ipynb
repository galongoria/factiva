In general, he says he still has a\\nhard time finding bargains, but he did take the time to single one out\\nrecently: the Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust, run by Canadian\\nPacific.\\n\\n\\nIn fact, when asked during a recent interview in The New York Times what\\nhe felt was worth buying, Mr. Grant mentioned just three things --\\nsmall-capitalization Asian stocks, gold and the Legacy REIT. He called it\\n\"a real estate investment trust with a bunch of lovely properties\" that\\nyou could buy \"for about half of book value, with a yield in the low\\nteens.\"', 'TD': 'The comments from Mr. Grant, a veteran U.S. market analyst, boosted the\\nprice of the trust units substantially. What makes his opinion even more\\ninteresting is that a year ago, when the Legacy trust was first\\nestablished, Mr. Grant was still extremely critical of the whole income\\ntrust phenomenon, which he felt was overpromoted in an almost\\nirresponsible way.\\n\\n\\nThere\\'s another interesting aspect to the recommendation of Legacy by Mr.\\nGrant, which appeared in more detail in a recent issue of his widely read\\nGrant\\'s Interest Rate Observer newsletter. Legacy was first brought to his\\nattention by long-time collaborator and fellow bear, Calgary-based\\nmerchant banker Charles (Chuck) Charlton.\\n\\n\\nMr. Charlton, who has run a boutique investment banking firm in Alberta\\nsince 1980, was also critical of the income trust frenzy when it exploded\\nlast year. In fact, it was at his urging that Mr. Grant made a speech at a\\nCanadian financial analysts\\' conference attacking the way trusts were\\nbeing marketed to retail investors by pushing high rates of return.\\n\\n\\n\"I thought it was disgusting the way the corporate finance and\\nunderwriting community was promoting these things, and I called it to his\\nattention,\" Mr. Charlton says. \"So I think he was kind of surprised when I\\ncalled him about Legacy and suggested he have a look at it.\" In his\\nOctober newsletter, Mr. Grant gives Mr. Charlton credit for drawing his\\nattention to the REIT.\\n\\n\\nIn his commentary, Mr. Grant says \"the search for a safe and sane high\\nyield\" in North America \"resembles the search for a vacant parking spot on\\nthe streets of midtown Manhattan: If you find it, there must be something\\nwrong with it.\" Attracted by Legacy\\'s high yield of about 14 per cent, Mr.\\nGrant says he \"tried to find out what\\'s wrong with it.\"\\n\\n\\nHowever, after reviewing the portfolio -- which includes some of CP\\'s\\nbest executive hotels (although not the crown jewels, such as Banff\\nSprings) -- and going over the trust\\'s balance sheet, Mr. Grant comes as\\nclose as he ever does to a \"buy\" rating, saying \"we have arrived at a\\nbullish conclusion: The potential upside outweighs the likely downside.\"\\n\\n\\nAt their price at the time of $5.90, the units -- issued at $9 -- were\\ntrading for half the trust\\'s book value, with a yield of 16 per cent. The\\nunits have since risen to $7 (dropping the yield to 13 per cent), buoyed\\nnot only by Mr. Grant\\'s comments but also by the fact that all the buyers\\nwho paid using instalment receipts paid their second instalment of $4 on\\nNov. 10. CP has said it plans to buy more units, adding to its 33-per-cent\\nstake.\\n\\n\\nMr. Grant notes in his newsletter that another former critic of the trust\\n-- namely Richard Rooney, president of Toronto-based money manager\\nBurgundy Asset Management -- has also changed his mind to some extent.\\nLast year, Mr. Rooney wrote a scathing indictment of the trust phenomenon\\nand in fact singled out Legacy. But he told Mr. Grant that a yield of 12\\nto 15 per cent made him far more inclined to recommend investing in the\\nunits now.\\n\\n\\nAs for the Alberta connection in all this, Mr. Charlton says he has been\\none of Mr. Grant\\'s contacts for almost a decade, ever since a mutual\\nfriend in New York said they shared a certain perspective on the market.\\n\"Over the years I\\'ve done some background research for him on various\\nthings, whether it\\'s Ontario Hydro, or crude oil or the Canadian dollar.\"\\n\\n\\nHaving built his investment firm into a 60-person company with branches\\nin Calgary, Grande Prairie, Edmonton and Fort McMurray -- an expansion\\nstrategy he admits now was probably a mistake -- Mr. Charlton is now back\\nwhere he began. He sold the firm to Canadian Western Bank earlier this\\nyear, and now runs a small boutique that specializes in private\\nplacements.\\n\\n\\nAlthough Mr. Charlton says he has great respect for Mr. Grant, who he\\ndescribes as \"an individualistic thinker with a brilliant mind,\" that\\ndoesn\\'t mean the two agree on everything. \"Sometimes we disagree violently\\n-- we have for years on crude oil, for example. He\\'s a great bull and I\\'ve\\nbeen a great bear, but we\\'ve agreed to disagree on that one.\"\\n\\n\\nBusiness West readers can reach Mathew Ingram by fax at (403) 244-9809 or\\nby E-mail at\\nmingram@globeandmail.ca', 'CO': 'leghot : Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust', 'IN': 'i85 : Real Estate Transactions | icre : Construction/Real Estate', 'NS': 'ncat : Content Types | nedc : Commentary/Opinion', 'RE': 'caab : Alberta | cana : Canada | namz : North America | usa : United States | use : Northeast U.S. | usny : New York', 'IPC': 'LGY', 'IPD': 'Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust  | James Grant', 'AN': 'Document glob000020011205dubj01pup'}, {'company_code': 'leghot', 'news_code': 'sfglob', 'date': '1998', 'CLM': 'INVESTMENT NEWS', 'SE': 'Report on Business', 'HD': 'Legacy Hotels', 'WC': '59 words', 'PD': '12 November 1998', 'SN': 'The Globe and Mail', 'SC': 'GLOB', 'ED': 'Metro', 'PG': 'B26', 'LA': 'English', 'CY': 'All material copyright Thomson Canada Limited or its licensors.

Legacy was first brought to his\\nattention by long-time collaborator and fellow bear, Calgary-based\\nmerchant banker Charles (Chuck) Charlton.\\n\\n\\nMr. Charlton, who has run a boutique investment banking firm in Alberta\\nsince 1980, was also critical of the income trust frenzy when it exploded\\nlast year.

The\\nunits have since risen to $7 (dropping the yield to 13 per cent), buoyed\\nnot only by Mr. Grant\\'s comments but also by the fact that all the buyers\\nwho paid using instalment receipts paid their second instalment of $4 on\\nNov. 10. CP has said it plans to buy more units, adding to its 33-per-cent\\nstake.\\n\\n\\nMr. Grant notes in his newsletter that another former critic of the trust\\n-- namely Richard Rooney, president of Toronto-based money manager\\nBurgundy Asset Management -- has also changed his mind to some extent.\\nLast year, Mr. Rooney wrote a scathing indictment of the trust phenomenon\\nand in fact singled out Legacy. But he told Mr. Grant that a yield of 12\\nto 15 per cent made him far more inclined to recommend investing in the\\nunits now.\\n\\n\\nAs for the Alberta connection in all this, Mr. Charlton says he has been\\none of Mr. Grant\\'s contacts for almost a decade, ever since a mutual\\nfriend in New York said they shared a certain perspective on the market.\\n\"Over the years I\\'ve done some background research for him on various\\nthings, whether it\\'s Ontario Hydro, or crude oil or the Canadian dollar.\"\\n\\n\\nHaving built his investment firm into a 60-person company with branches\\nin Calgary, Grande Prairie, Edmonton and Fort McMurray -- an expansion\\nstrategy he admits now was probably a mistake -- Mr. Charlton is now back\\nwhere he began.

All rights reserved.', 'LP': 'Calgary -- James Grant is one of Wall Street\\'s best-known \"bears,\" a\\nthoughtful but pessimistic watcher of markets who has found very little\\nworth buying over the past few years. In general, he says he still has a\\nhard time finding bargains, but he did take the time to single one out\\nrecently: the Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust, run by Canadian\\nPacific.\\n\\n\\nIn fact, when asked during a recent interview in The New York Times what\\nhe felt was worth buying, Mr. Grant mentioned just three things --\\nsmall-capitalization Asian stocks, gold and the Legacy REIT. He called it\\n\"a real estate investment trust with a bunch of lovely properties\" that\\nyou could buy \"for about half of book value, with a yield in the low\\nteens.\"', 'TD': 'The comments from Mr. Grant, a veteran U.S. market analyst, boosted the\\nprice of the trust units substantially. What makes his opinion even more\\ninteresting is that a year ago, when the Legacy trust was first\\nestablished, Mr. Grant was still extremely critical of the whole income\\ntrust phenomenon, which he felt was overpromoted in an almost\\nirresponsible way.\\n\\n\\nThere\\'s another interesting aspect to the recommendation of Legacy by Mr.\\nGrant, which appeared in more detail in a recent issue of his widely read\\nGrant\\'s Interest Rate Observer newsletter. Legacy was first brought to his\\nattention by long-time collaborator and fellow bear, Calgary-based\\nmerchant banker Charles (Chuck) Charlton.\\n\\n\\nMr. Charlton, who has run a boutique investment banking firm in Alberta\\nsince 1980, was also critical of the income trust frenzy when it exploded\\nlast year. In fact, it was at his urging that Mr. Grant made a speech at a\\nCanadian financial analysts\\' conference attacking the way trusts were\\nbeing marketed to retail investors by pushing high rates of return.\\n\\n\\n\"I thought it was disgusting the way the corporate finance and\\nunderwriting community was promoting these things, and I called it to his\\nattention,\" Mr. Charlton says. \"So I think he was kind of surprised when I\\ncalled him about Legacy and suggested he have a look at it.\" In his\\nOctober newsletter, Mr. Grant gives Mr. Charlton credit for drawing his\\nattention to the REIT.\\n\\n\\nIn his commentary, Mr. Grant says \"the search for a safe and sane high\\nyield\" in North America \"resembles the search for a vacant parking spot on\\nthe streets of midtown Manhattan: If you find it, there must be something\\nwrong with it.\" Attracted by Legacy\\'s high yield of about 14 per cent, Mr.\\nGrant says he \"tried to find out what\\'s wrong with it.\"\\n\\n\\nHowever, after reviewing the portfolio -- which includes some of CP\\'s\\nbest executive hotels (although not the crown jewels, such as Banff\\nSprings) -- and going over the trust\\'s balance sheet, Mr. Grant comes as\\nclose as he ever does to a \"buy\" rating, saying \"we have arrived at a\\nbullish conclusion: The potential upside outweighs the likely downside.\"\\n\\n\\nAt their price at the time of $5.90, the units -- issued at $9 -- were\\ntrading for half the trust\\'s book value, with a yield of 16 per cent. The\\nunits have since risen to $7 (dropping the yield to 13 per cent), buoyed\\nnot only by Mr. Grant\\'s comments but also by the fact that all the buyers\\nwho paid using instalment receipts paid their second instalment of $4 on\\nNov. 10. CP has said it plans to buy more units, adding to its 33-per-cent\\nstake.\\n\\n\\nMr. Grant notes in his newsletter that another former critic of the trust\\n-- namely Richard Rooney, president of Toronto-based money manager\\nBurgundy Asset Management -- has also changed his mind to some extent.\\nLast year, Mr. Rooney wrote a scathing indictment of the trust phenomenon\\nand in fact singled out Legacy. But he told Mr. Grant that a yield of 12\\nto 15 per cent made him far more inclined to recommend investing in the\\nunits now.\\n\\n\\nAs for the Alberta connection in all this, Mr. Charlton says he has been\\none of Mr. Grant\\'s contacts for almost a decade, ever since a mutual\\nfriend in New York said they shared a certain perspective on the market.\\n\"Over the years I\\'ve done some background research for him on various\\nthings, whether it\\'s Ontario Hydro, or crude oil or the Canadian dollar.\"\\n\\n\\nHaving built his investment firm into a 60-person company with branches\\nin Calgary, Grande Prairie, Edmonton and Fort McMurray -- an expansion\\nstrategy he admits now was probably a mistake -- Mr. Charlton is now back\\nwhere he began. He sold the firm to Canadian Western Bank earlier this\\nyear, and now runs a small boutique that specializes in private\\nplacements.\\n\\n\\nAlthough Mr. Charlton says he has great respect for Mr. Grant, who he\\ndescribes as \"an individualistic thinker with a brilliant mind,\" that\\ndoesn\\'t mean the two agree on everything. \"Sometimes we disagree violently\\n-- we have for years on crude oil, for example. He\\'s a great bull and I\\'ve\\nbeen a great bear, but we\\'ve agreed to disagree on that one.\"\\n\\n\\nBusiness West readers can reach Mathew Ingram by fax at (403) 244-9809 or\\nby E-mail at\\nmingram@globeandmail.ca', 'CO': 'leghot : Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust', 'IN': 'i85 : Real Estate Transactions | icre : Construction/Real Estate', 'NS': 'ncat : Content Types | nedc : Commentary/Opinion', 'RE': 'caab : Alberta | cana : Canada | namz : North America | usa : United States | use : Northeast U.S. | usny : New York', 'IPC': 'LGY', 'IPD': 'Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust  | James Grant', 'AN': 'Document glob000020011205dubj01pup'}, {'company_code': 'leghot', 'news_code': 'sfglob', 'date': '1998', 'CLM': 'INVESTMENT NEWS', 'SE': 'Report on Business', 'HD': 'Legacy Hotels', 'WC': '59 words', 'PD': '12 November 1998', 'SN': 'The Globe and Mail', 'SC': 'GLOB', 'ED': 'Metro', 'PG': 'B26', 'LA': 'English', 'CY': 'All material copyright Thomson Canada Limited or its licensors.

In general, he says he still has a\\nhard time finding bargains, but he did take the time to single one out\\nrecently: the Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust, run by Canadian\\nPacific.\\n\\n\\nIn fact, when asked during a recent interview in The New York Times what\\nhe felt was worth buying, Mr. Grant mentioned just three things --\\nsmall-capitalization Asian stocks, gold and the Legacy REIT. He called it\\n\"a real estate investment trust with a bunch of lovely properties\" that\\nyou could buy \"for about half of book value, with a yield in the low\\nteens.\"', 'TD': 'The comments from Mr. Grant, a veteran U.S. market analyst, boosted the\\nprice of the trust units substantially. What makes his opinion even more\\ninteresting is that a year ago, when the Legacy trust was first\\nestablished, Mr. Grant was still extremely critical of the whole income\\ntrust phenomenon, which he felt was overpromoted in an almost\\nirresponsible way.\\n\\n\\nThere\\'s another interesting aspect to the recommendation of Legacy by Mr.\\nGrant, which appeared in more detail in a recent issue of his widely read\\nGrant\\'s Interest Rate Observer newsletter. Legacy was first brought to his\\nattention by long-time collaborator and fellow bear, Calgary-based\\nmerchant banker Charles (Chuck) Charlton.\\n\\n\\nMr. Charlton, who has run a boutique investment banking firm in Alberta\\nsince 1980, was also critical of the income trust frenzy when it exploded\\nlast year. In fact, it was at his urging that Mr. Grant made a speech at a\\nCanadian financial analysts\\' conference attacking the way trusts were\\nbeing marketed to retail investors by pushing high rates of return.\\n\\n\\n\"I thought it was disgusting the way the corporate finance and\\nunderwriting community was promoting these things, and I called it to his\\nattention,\" Mr. Charlton says. \"So I think he was kind of surprised when I\\ncalled him about Legacy and suggested he have a look at it.\" In his\\nOctober newsletter, Mr. Grant gives Mr. Charlton credit for drawing his\\nattention to the REIT.\\n\\n\\nIn his commentary, Mr. Grant says \"the search for a safe and sane high\\nyield\" in North America \"resembles the search for a vacant parking spot on\\nthe streets of midtown Manhattan: If you find it, there must be something\\nwrong with it.\" Attracted by Legacy\\'s high yield of about 14 per cent, Mr.\\nGrant says he \"tried to find out what\\'s wrong with it.\"\\n\\n\\nHowever, after reviewing the portfolio -- which includes some of CP\\'s\\nbest executive hotels (although not the crown jewels, such as Banff\\nSprings) -- and going over the trust\\'s balance sheet, Mr. Grant comes as\\nclose as he ever does to a \"buy\" rating, saying \"we have arrived at a\\nbullish conclusion: The potential upside outweighs the likely downside.\"\\n\\n\\nAt their price at the time of $5.90, the units -- issued at $9 -- were\\ntrading for half the trust\\'s book value, with a yield of 16 per cent. The\\nunits have since risen to $7 (dropping the yield to 13 per cent), buoyed\\nnot only by Mr. Grant\\'s comments but also by the fact that all the buyers\\nwho paid using instalment receipts paid their second instalment of $4 on\\nNov. 10. CP has said it plans to buy more units, adding to its 33-per-cent\\nstake.\\n\\n\\nMr. Grant notes in his newsletter that another former critic of the trust\\n-- namely Richard Rooney, president of Toronto-based money manager\\nBurgundy Asset Management -- has also changed his mind to some extent.\\nLast year, Mr. Rooney wrote a scathing indictment of the trust phenomenon\\nand in fact singled out Legacy. But he told Mr. Grant that a yield of 12\\nto 15 per cent made him far more inclined to recommend investing in the\\nunits now.\\n\\n\\nAs for the Alberta connection in all this, Mr. Charlton says he has been\\none of Mr. Grant\\'s contacts for almost a decade, ever since a mutual\\nfriend in New York said they shared a certain perspective on the market.\\n\"Over the years I\\'ve done some background research for him on various\\nthings, whether it\\'s Ontario Hydro, or crude oil or the Canadian dollar.\"\\n\\n\\nHaving built his investment firm into a 60-person company with branches\\nin Calgary, Grande Prairie, Edmonton and Fort McMurray -- an expansion\\nstrategy he admits now was probably a mistake -- Mr. Charlton is now back\\nwhere he began. He sold the firm to Canadian Western Bank earlier this\\nyear, and now runs a small boutique that specializes in private\\nplacements.\\n\\n\\nAlthough Mr. Charlton says he has great respect for Mr. Grant, who he\\ndescribes as \"an individualistic thinker with a brilliant mind,\" that\\ndoesn\\'t mean the two agree on everything. \"Sometimes we disagree violently\\n-- we have for years on crude oil, for example. He\\'s a great bull and I\\'ve\\nbeen a great bear, but we\\'ve agreed to disagree on that one.\"\\n\\n\\nBusiness West readers can reach Mathew Ingram by fax at (403) 244-9809 or\\nby E-mail at\\nmingram@globeandmail.ca', 'CO': 'leghot : Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust', 'IN': 'i85 : Real Estate Transactions | icre : Construction/Real Estate', 'NS': 'ncat : Content Types | nedc : Commentary/Opinion', 'RE': 'caab : Alberta | cana : Canada | namz : North America | usa : United States | use : Northeast U.S. | usny : New York', 'IPC': 'LGY', 'IPD': 'Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust  | James Grant', 'AN': 'Document glob000020011205dubj01pup'}, {'company_code': 'leghot', 'news_code': 'sfglob', 'date': '1998', 'CLM': 'INVESTMENT NEWS', 'SE': 'Report on Business', 'HD': 'Legacy Hotels', 'WC': '59 words', 'PD': '12 November 1998', 'SN': 'The Globe and Mail', 'SC': 'GLOB', 'ED': 'Metro', 'PG': 'B26', 'LA': 'English', 'CY': 'All material copyright Thomson Canada Limited or its licensors.

All rights reserved.', 'LP': 'Calgary -- James Grant is one of Wall Street\\'s best-known \"bears,\" a\\nthoughtful but pessimistic watcher of markets who has found very little\\nworth buying over the past few years. In general, he says he still has a\\nhard time finding bargains, but he did take the time to single one out\\nrecently: the Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust, run by Canadian\\nPacific.\\n\\n\\nIn fact, when asked during a recent interview in The New York Times what\\nhe felt was worth buying, Mr. Grant mentioned just three things --\\nsmall-capitalization Asian stocks, gold and the Legacy REIT. He called it\\n\"a real estate investment trust with a bunch of lovely properties\" that\\nyou could buy \"for about half of book value, with a yield in the low\\nteens.\"', 'TD': 'The comments from Mr. Grant, a veteran U.S. market analyst, boosted the\\nprice of the trust units substantially. What makes his opinion even more\\ninteresting is that a year ago, when the Legacy trust was first\\nestablished, Mr. Grant was still extremely critical of the whole income\\ntrust phenomenon, which he felt was overpromoted in an almost\\nirresponsible way.\\n\\n\\nThere\\'s another interesting aspect to the recommendation of Legacy by Mr.\\nGrant, which appeared in more detail in a recent issue of his widely read\\nGrant\\'s Interest Rate Observer newsletter. Legacy was first brought to his\\nattention by long-time collaborator and fellow bear, Calgary-based\\nmerchant banker Charles (Chuck) Charlton.\\n\\n\\nMr. Charlton, who has run a boutique investment banking firm in Alberta\\nsince 1980, was also critical of the income trust frenzy when it exploded\\nlast year. In fact, it was at his urging that Mr. Grant made a speech at a\\nCanadian financial analysts\\' conference attacking the way trusts were\\nbeing marketed to retail investors by pushing high rates of return.\\n\\n\\n\"I thought it was disgusting the way the corporate finance and\\nunderwriting community was promoting these things, and I called it to his\\nattention,\" Mr. Charlton says. \"So I think he was kind of surprised when I\\ncalled him about Legacy and suggested he have a look at it.\" In his\\nOctober newsletter, Mr. Grant gives Mr. Charlton credit for drawing his\\nattention to the REIT.\\n\\n\\nIn his commentary, Mr. Grant says \"the search for a safe and sane high\\nyield\" in North America \"resembles the search for a vacant parking spot on\\nthe streets of midtown Manhattan: If you find it, there must be something\\nwrong with it.\" Attracted by Legacy\\'s high yield of about 14 per cent, Mr.\\nGrant says he \"tried to find out what\\'s wrong with it.\"\\n\\n\\nHowever, after reviewing the portfolio -- which includes some of CP\\'s\\nbest executive hotels (although not the crown jewels, such as Banff\\nSprings) -- and going over the trust\\'s balance sheet, Mr. Grant comes as\\nclose as he ever does to a \"buy\" rating, saying \"we have arrived at a\\nbullish conclusion: The potential upside outweighs the likely downside.\"\\n\\n\\nAt their price at the time of $5.90, the units -- issued at $9 -- were\\ntrading for half the trust\\'s book value, with a yield of 16 per cent. The\\nunits have since risen to $7 (dropping the yield to 13 per cent), buoyed\\nnot only by Mr. Grant\\'s comments but also by the fact that all the buyers\\nwho paid using instalment receipts paid their second instalment of $4 on\\nNov. 10. CP has said it plans to buy more units, adding to its 33-per-cent\\nstake.\\n\\n\\nMr. Grant notes in his newsletter that another former critic of the trust\\n-- namely Richard Rooney, president of Toronto-based money manager\\nBurgundy Asset Management -- has also changed his mind to some extent.\\nLast year, Mr. Rooney wrote a scathing indictment of the trust phenomenon\\nand in fact singled out Legacy. But he told Mr. Grant that a yield of 12\\nto 15 per cent made him far more inclined to recommend investing in the\\nunits now.\\n\\n\\nAs for the Alberta connection in all this, Mr. Charlton says he has been\\none of Mr. Grant\\'s contacts for almost a decade, ever since a mutual\\nfriend in New York said they shared a certain perspective on the market.\\n\"Over the years I\\'ve done some background research for him on various\\nthings, whether it\\'s Ontario Hydro, or crude oil or the Canadian dollar.\"\\n\\n\\nHaving built his investment firm into a 60-person company with branches\\nin Calgary, Grande Prairie, Edmonton and Fort McMurray -- an expansion\\nstrategy he admits now was probably a mistake -- Mr. Charlton is now back\\nwhere he began. He sold the firm to Canadian Western Bank earlier this\\nyear, and now runs a small boutique that specializes in private\\nplacements.\\n\\n\\nAlthough Mr. Charlton says he has great respect for Mr. Grant, who he\\ndescribes as \"an individualistic thinker with a brilliant mind,\" that\\ndoesn\\'t mean the two agree on everything. \"Sometimes we disagree violently\\n-- we have for years on crude oil, for example. He\\'s a great bull and I\\'ve\\nbeen a great bear, but we\\'ve agreed to disagree on that one.\"\\n\\n\\nBusiness West readers can reach Mathew Ingram by fax at (403) 244-9809 or\\nby E-mail at\\nmingram@globeandmail.ca', 'CO': 'leghot : Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust', 'IN': 'i85 : Real Estate Transactions | icre : Construction/Real Estate', 'NS': 'ncat : Content Types | nedc : Commentary/Opinion', 'RE': 'caab : Alberta | cana : Canada | namz : North America | usa : United States | use : Northeast U.S. | usny : New York', 'IPC': 'LGY', 'IPD': 'Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust  | James Grant', 'AN': 'Document glob000020011205dubj01pup'}, {'company_code': 'leghot', 'news_code': 'sfglob', 'date': '1998', 'CLM': 'INVESTMENT NEWS', 'SE': 'Report on Business', 'HD': 'Legacy Hotels', 'WC': '59 words', 'PD': '12 November 1998', 'SN': 'The Globe and Mail', 'SC': 'GLOB', 'ED': 'Metro', 'PG': 'B26', 'LA': 'English', 'CY': 'All material copyright Thomson Canada Limited or its licensors.

Last month, falling business prompted the REIT to announced that it would suspend distributions for the second consecutive quarter.', 'TD': 'Mr. Labatte would not speculate on when investors might see their next distribution cheque, but he did say that traditionally the hotel chain gets an idea of its business levels in the second quarter.  \\n\"We won\\'t be paying distributions until we get a clear view of the business,\" he said in an interview. When payments do resume, Legacy will hand out less than its total distributable profit, leaving an unspecified percentage in reserve.  \\nLegacy reported that profit fell to $17.5-million in the most recent quarter from $37.5-million during the same time last year. For the first nine months of the year, profit was $780,000, down from $47.5-million during the same time a year earlier.  \\nRevenue for the third quarter was $189-million, down from $194-million a year earlier.  \\nRevenue per available room — a benchmark in the industry — tumbled by 30 per cent at both Toronto\\'s Royal York and the Château Frontenac in Quebec City in the third quarter.

Legacy attributed the drop to lower occupancy levels and rates.  \\nEBITDA, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, was $48.2-million, down from $61.2-million a year earlier.  \\nShares of Legacy closed yesterday on the Toronto Stock Exchange at $6.39, off 1 cent.  \\nAlso yesterday, Legacy released the details of its recent purchase of two U.S. properties, one in Washington, D.C., and the other in Seattle.

Year to date, the REIT universe in Canada is down 14 per cent, she said. “When interest rates rise, REITs tend to fall because investors have alternate investments to go to, such as government bonds,” she added.  \\nMichael Smith, an analyst at National Bank Financial Inc., said he also expects the second-quarter results to show a “material bounce back from an unusually hard-hit quarter last year.”  \\nUnits of Legacy rose 5 cents to close at $6.95 on the Toronto Stock Exchange.\", 'CO': 'leghot : Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust', 'IN': 'i81502 : Trusts/Funds/Financial Vehicles | i8150206 : Investment Trusts/Funds | i815020602 : Real Estate Investment Trusts | i6651 : Hotels (except Casino)/Motels | ireest : Real Estate | i66 : Hotels/Restaurants/Casinos | i665 : Lodgings | icre : Construction/Real Estate | iinv : Investing/Securities', 'NS': 'c151 : Earnings | c1512 : Dividends | ccat : Corporate/Industrial News | c15 : Performance', 'RE': 'cana : Canada | namz : North America', 'IPD': 'travel industry  | hotels  | investments  | stocks  | ROB 1000  | $LGY.UN  | Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust', 'PUB': 'Bell Globemedia Interactive', 'AN': 'Document GLOB000020040615e06f0003i'}, {'company_code': 'leghot', 'news_code': 'sfglob', 'date': '2004', 'CLM': 'REAL ESTATE', 'SE': 'Report on Business: Canadian', 'HD': 'Fairmont to reduce stake in Legacy; New accounting rules prompting sale of trust units', 'BY': 'RICHARD BLOOM', 'WC': '488 words', 'PD': '28 April 2004', 'SN': 'The Globe and Mail', 'SC': 'GLOB', 'PG': 'B7', 'LA': 'English', 'CY': 'All material copyright Bell Globemedia Publishing Inc. or its licensors.

Legacy is also based in Toronto.', 'TD': \"Since Legacy's creation in 1997, Fairmont has accounted for its stake on an equity basis. Under new Canadian accounting rules that come into effect next year, Fairmont will have to account for Legacy's financial results on its balance sheet. Those same rules went into effect in the United States this year.  \\nFairmont does not have to include Legacy's results should it reduce its stake to below 25-per-cent, it said.  \\n“Fairmont believes that consolidating Legacy would complicate investors' ability to assess Fairmont's financial performance,” Legacy said in a statement.  \\nAny sale would be “subject to favourable market conditions,” the companies said.  \\nHowever, conditions for interest-rate-sensitive income trust units have been anything but favourable in recent weeks. The sector has taken a beating amid signs of improving economic conditions across North America and fears that inflation may soon climb. Rising inflation and, in turn, increasing interest rates make holding trusts less attractive, because investors can get higher rates of return on a variety of other investment vehicles.  \\nAnalysts, meanwhile, were generally positive about the possible sale. Deutsche Bank's Marc Falcone said consolidating Legacy into Fairmont's results would “unduly distort” Fairmont's financial performance and attractiveness as an investment.  \\nGoldman Sachs analyst Steven Kent agreed, saying “the close relationship between the two . . . has always caused concern with investors who questioned whether or not some of the asset dispositions were arm's-length transactions.”  \\nThe announcements came alongside weaker first-quarter results at Fairmont, which posted a loss of nearly $600,000 (U.S.) or 1 cent a share, compared with a profit of $12.5-million or 16 cents a year earlier. Sales rose slightly to $168.2-million from $167.9-million.  \\nThe news also followed an April 20 announcement from Legacy that it may sell parts of its hotel portfolio. It said it is considering unloading some of its non-core assets, such as its Delta hotels in Canada, possibly this year. That prospect was cheered by some analysts, who were encouraged that Legacy was taking a “more disciplined” approach to its finances.  \\nThe Fairmont Royal York and Fairmont Le Château Frontenac, two landmark hotels, are not expected to be part of that sale.  \\nUnits of Legacy dipped 10 cents to $7.07 on the Toronto Stock Exchange yesterday while Fairmont shares dropped $1.50 to close at $34.75.\", 'ART': 'Illustration', 'CO': 'farmnt : Fairmont Hotels & Resorts Inc | leghot : Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust', 'IN': 'i665 : Lodgings | i6651 : Hotels (except Casino)/Motels | i8150206 : Investment Trusts/Funds | ireest : Real Estate | i66 : Hotels/Restaurants/Casinos | i81502 : Trusts/Funds/Financial Vehicles | i815020602 : Real Estate Investment Trusts | icre : Construction/Real Estate | iinv : Investing/Securities', 'NS': 'ccat : Corporate/Industrial News', 'RE': 'cana : Canada | namz : North America', 'IPD': 'income trusts  | ROB 1000  | $FHR  | $LGY.UN  | Fairmont Hotels &  | Resorts Inc.  | Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust', 'PUB': 'Bell Globemedia Interactive', 'AN': 'Document GLOB000020040428e04s0004e'}, {'company_code': 'leghot', 'news_code': 'sfglob', 'date': '2004', 'SE': 'Business', 'HD': 'Fairmont slumps to loss', 'BY': 'ROMA LUCIW', 'WC': '380 words', 'PD': '27 April 2004', 'SN': 'Breaking News from globeandmail.com', 'SC': 'GMBN', 'LA': 'English', 'CY': 'All material copyright Bell Globemedia Publishing Inc. or its licensors.

Fairmont saw its EBIDTA fall as its real estate activities were down $8-million, partly as a result of a onetime gain a year ago. Its equity investment earnings, from Legacy Hotels, fell $7-million.  \\nThe outbreak of the SARS virus early last year slammed tourism in Canada, and particularly in Toronto, and has been weighing on Fairmont\\'s results.  \\nIn addition, Hurricane Fabian damaged two Fairmont properties in Bermuda. One hotel is closed for repairs until the spring while the other is operational. The company said the damage not covered by insurance is $9-million, of which $1.6-million was recorded in the fourth quarter and the rest in third. (That total is down from an earlier estimate of $10-million to $12-million.)  \\nFourth-quarter operating revenues rose 9.2 to $137.1-million from $125.6-million, boosted by the recent acquisitions of The Fairmont Copley Plaza in Boston and The Fairmont Orchid in Hawaii.  \\nOperating revenues from managed and franchised properties rose 9.5 per cent to $144.9-million from $132.3-million.  \\n“While the appreciation in the Canadian dollar was a key driver of increased revenues, it had a considerable impact on expenses in the fourth quarter,” Fairmont said.  \\nRevenue per available room -- an important measure of profitability for hotel operators -- rose 8.8 per cent at hotels owned by Fairmont. At the hotels it manages, revenue per available room rose 5 per cent. Fairmont said RevPAR continued to improve over year-earlier levels at all of its properties.  \\nOccupancy levels fell 1.3 per cent at both its owned and managed hotels.  \\nFairmont operates more than 80 hotels under the Fairmont and Delta banners, including the landmark former CP Hotels owned by Legacy.  \\nFor the full year, Fairmont earned $50.7-million or 64 cents, down 45 per cent from $92.5-million or $1.18 in 2002. Sales were $658.8-million, up from $590.6-million.  \\nMr. Fatt was optimistic that Fairmont\\'s properties would recover in 2004. “We continue to be encouraged by a number of positive signs that point to a recovery this year.”  \\nHe estimates that full-year profit would range from $65-million and $71-million and per share earnings between 82 cents and 90 cents.

In general, he says he still has a\\nhard time finding bargains, but he did take the time to single one out\\nrecently: the Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust, run by Canadian\\nPacific.\\n\\n\\nIn fact, when asked during a recent interview in The New York Times what\\nhe felt was worth buying, Mr. Grant mentioned just three things --\\nsmall-capitalization Asian stocks, gold and the Legacy REIT. He called it\\n\"a real estate investment trust with a bunch of lovely properties\" that\\nyou could buy \"for about half of book value, with a yield in the low\\nteens.\"', 'TD': 'The comments from Mr. Grant, a veteran U.S. market analyst, boosted the\\nprice of the trust units substantially. What makes his opinion even more\\ninteresting is that a year ago, when the Legacy trust was first\\nestablished, Mr. Grant was still extremely critical of the whole income\\ntrust phenomenon, which he felt was overpromoted in an almost\\nirresponsible way.\\n\\n\\nThere\\'s another interesting aspect to the recommendation of Legacy by Mr.\\nGrant, which appeared in more detail in a recent issue of his widely read\\nGrant\\'s Interest Rate Observer newsletter. Legacy was first brought to his\\nattention by long-time collaborator and fellow bear, Calgary-based\\nmerchant banker Charles (Chuck) Charlton.\\n\\n\\nMr. Charlton, who has run a boutique investment banking firm in Alberta\\nsince 1980, was also critical of the income trust frenzy when it exploded\\nlast year. In fact, it was at his urging that Mr. Grant made a speech at a\\nCanadian financial analysts\\' conference attacking the way trusts were\\nbeing marketed to retail investors by pushing high rates of return.\\n\\n\\n\"I thought it was disgusting the way the corporate finance and\\nunderwriting community was promoting these things, and I called it to his\\nattention,\" Mr. Charlton says. \"So I think he was kind of surprised when I\\ncalled him about Legacy and suggested he have a look at it.\" In his\\nOctober newsletter, Mr. Grant gives Mr. Charlton credit for drawing his\\nattention to the REIT.\\n\\n\\nIn his commentary, Mr. Grant says \"the search for a safe and sane high\\nyield\" in North America \"resembles the search for a vacant parking spot on\\nthe streets of midtown Manhattan: If you find it, there must be something\\nwrong with it.\" Attracted by Legacy\\'s high yield of about 14 per cent, Mr.\\nGrant says he \"tried to find out what\\'s wrong with it.\"\\n\\n\\nHowever, after reviewing the portfolio -- which includes some of CP\\'s\\nbest executive hotels (although not the crown jewels, such as Banff\\nSprings) -- and going over the trust\\'s balance sheet, Mr. Grant comes as\\nclose as he ever does to a \"buy\" rating, saying \"we have arrived at a\\nbullish conclusion: The potential upside outweighs the likely downside.\"\\n\\n\\nAt their price at the time of $5.90, the units -- issued at $9 -- were\\ntrading for half the trust\\'s book value, with a yield of 16 per cent. The\\nunits have since risen to $7 (dropping the yield to 13 per cent), buoyed\\nnot only by Mr. Grant\\'s comments but also by the fact that all the buyers\\nwho paid using instalment receipts paid their second instalment of $4 on\\nNov. 10. CP has said it plans to buy more units, adding to its 33-per-cent\\nstake.\\n\\n\\nMr. Grant notes in his newsletter that another former critic of the trust\\n-- namely Richard Rooney, president of Toronto-based money manager\\nBurgundy Asset Management -- has also changed his mind to some extent.\\nLast year, Mr. Rooney wrote a scathing indictment of the trust phenomenon\\nand in fact singled out Legacy. But he told Mr. Grant that a yield of 12\\nto 15 per cent made him far more inclined to recommend investing in the\\nunits now.\\n\\n\\nAs for the Alberta connection in all this, Mr. Charlton says he has been\\none of Mr. Grant\\'s contacts for almost a decade, ever since a mutual\\nfriend in New York said they shared a certain perspective on the market.\\n\"Over the years I\\'ve done some background research for him on various\\nthings, whether it\\'s Ontario Hydro, or crude oil or the Canadian dollar.\"\\n\\n\\nHaving built his investment firm into a 60-person company with branches\\nin Calgary, Grande Prairie, Edmonton and Fort McMurray -- an expansion\\nstrategy he admits now was probably a mistake -- Mr. Charlton is now back\\nwhere he began. He sold the firm to Canadian Western Bank earlier this\\nyear, and now runs a small boutique that specializes in private\\nplacements.\\n\\n\\nAlthough Mr. Charlton says he has great respect for Mr. Grant, who he\\ndescribes as \"an individualistic thinker with a brilliant mind,\" that\\ndoesn\\'t mean the two agree on everything. \"Sometimes we disagree violently\\n-- we have for years on crude oil, for example.

I would call it a level of\\nprudence given the uncertain business volumes for the third quarter.\"\\n\\n\\nMr. Labatte described the suspension as a reaction to a short-term\\ndisruption.\\n\\n\\nNews of the halt in distributions for the quarter sent units of the real\\nestate investment trust tumbling more than 10 per cent to a new 12-month\\nlow of $5.21, down from $5.76 in heavy trading on the Toronto Stock\\nExchange.\\n\\n\\nInvestment trusts are designed to distribute most of their income to\\nunitholders and are frequently purchased by investors for their income\\nstream.\\n\\n\\nLow interest rates and poor prospects for traditional equities have\\nprompted an increasing number of investors to enter the trust market.\\n\\n\\nGiven Legacy\\'s large presence in Toronto -- 20 per cent of its rooms are\\nin the city, with 13 per cent in the massive Royal York Hotel alone --\\nmany observers in the industry were expecting some cut to distributions,\\nbut not a complete suspension.\\n\\n\\n\"That\\'s a bit of a surprise, said TD Newcrest analyst Sam Damiani, who\\nearlier this month singled out Legacy as the most vulnerable to a\\ndistribution cut of the four hotel REITs that trade on the Toronto Stock\\nExchange.\\n\\n\\n\"The income trend has been pretty abysmal,\" he observed in an interview\\nearlier this month.\\n\\n\\nYesterday, he said that based on his estimates, Legacy just did not have\\nthe cash to meet its quarterly distribution level of 18.5 cents a unit.\\nThat adds up to about $19-million based on distributions in the first\\nquarter. \"A lot of it is money they don\\'t have.\"\\n\\n\\nMr. Labatte disagreed.\\n\\n\\n\"That would not be a fair assumption. We believe we have the financial\\nresources to implement our long-term business plan.\"\\n\\n\\nMr. Labatte did say that Legacy is reviewing its capital projects with\\nthe result that some may be pushed into next year from this fall. He said\\nhe expects regular maintenance programs to continue. \"The thing that we\\ndon\\'t want to do is to pursue a strategy of not investing in our hotels.\"\\n\\n\\nLegacy, which owns 22 hotels in Canada and one in the U.S. lost\\n$21.4-million in the first quarter, compared with $15.6-million in the\\nsame period last year. The first quarter is traditionally a slow period\\nfor the industry.\\n\\n\\nThe Calgary-based REIT was created close to six years ago to hold the\\nhotel properties of the former Canadian Pacific empire. Legacy owns the\\nhotels, but the properties are managed and run by Fairmont Hotels &\\nResorts Inc., which holds a 35-per-cent interest in the REIT.\\n\\n\\nUntil recently, Fairmont also provided all the senior executives for\\nLegacy. Mr. Labatte is the REIT\\'s first internal CEO, although he shares\\nhis time between Legacy and Fairmont. The REIT is currently searching for\\nits first full-time chief financial officer.\\n\\n\\nWhile Legacy is the first REIT to cut distributions because of the\\ncurrent troubles in the tourism industry, it may not be the last.\\n\\n\\nIn a research note earlier this month, Mr. Damiani at TD Newcrest said\\nRoyal Host REIT, which holds the Canadian master franchise for Travelodge\\nInternational Inc., could cut its distributions if demand does not\\nimprove.\\n\\n\\nA report released yesterday by the Hotel Association of Canada estimates\\nthat tourism spending in Toronto alone has fallen by about $211-million or\\nmore than 30 per cent from last year\\'s levels since the first Canadian\\nSARS death was reported in early March.\\n\\n\\nClose to $80-million of that loss was on accommodation spending in\\nToronto. \"It\\'s been hit the hardest, no question,\" said Tony Pollard,\\npresident of the Hotel Association of Canada.\\n\\n\\nRossa O\\'Reilly, who follows the real estate industry for CIBC World\\nMarkets, believes all four hotel sector REITs on the TSE are not the place\\nfor a conservative investor, given the current level of uncertainty in the\\nindustry. \"I think you have to view their distributions as high risk.\"\\n\\n\\nMr. O\\'Reilly said Legacy, because of its place in the Toronto market, is\\nthe most vulnerable to the problems caused by SARS. \"I think it was the\\nright thing to do, given the unknown business conditions, to suspend the\\ndistribution.\"\\n\\n\\nAn unsettled summer\\n\\n\\nSix-year-old Legacy Hotels real estate investment trust yesterday\\nsuspended its 18.5 cent distribution to investors for the second quarter,\\nsaying it can\\'t predict what the summer season will be like.

In Tuesday\\'s announcement, Toronto-based Legacy pointed to the devastating toll SARS is taking on hotels and on the overall tourism industry in Canada. \"Severe acute respiratory syndrome continues to have a significant effect on Toronto as well as the Canadian travel industry generally,\" said president and chief executive officer Neil Labatte. Although the company\\'s operating fundamentals are \"sound,\" he said the company\\'s board of trustees felt it was prudent to preserve financial resources. Its last distribution was 18.5 cents a unit. Looking ahead, Legacy said it \"remains cautious\" about its financial performance for the rest of the year.', 'TD': '\"It is difficult to predict the severity of the impact on our portfolio during the important summer months and therefore we remain cautious about our performance for the balance of the year,\" Mr. Labatte said. Legacy owns hotel properties across Canada that are managed by Fairmont Hotels & Resorts Inc. and Delta Hotels Ltd. Its hotels include the swanky Fairmont Empress in Victoria, Fairmont Le Château Frontenac in Quebec, and Fairmont Royal York in Toronto. The company reports its second quarter results on July 22. At that time, Legacy will provide an update on trends and its outlook for the year. Third-quarter distributions will be reviewed in September, the company said. \"We believe that current industry conditions will be short-term in nature and that Legacy is well-positioned to take advantage of a return to more normal business conditions,\" Mr. Labatte added. Units of Legacy slipped 60 cents or more than 10 per cent to $5.20 shortly before 1 p.m. EDT Tuesday. Fairmont stock dropped 7 cents or 2.2 per cent to $31.44.  \\nGlobe and Mail Update', 'CO': 'dltah : Delta Hotels Ltd | farmnt : Fairmont Hotels & Resorts Inc | leghot : Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust', 'IN': 'i665 : Lodgings | i6651 : Hotels (except Casino)/Motels | i66 : Hotels/Restaurants/Casinos | i81502 : Trusts/Funds/Financial Vehicles | i8150206 : Investment Trusts/Funds | i815020602 : Real Estate Investment Trusts | icre : Construction/Real Estate | iinv : Investing/Securities', 'RE': 'cana : Canada | namz : North America', 'IPD': 'legacy  | trust', 'PUB': 'Bell Globemedia Interactive', 'AN': 'Document GMBN000020030618dz6h00004'}, {'company_code': 'leghot', 'news_code': 'sfglob', 'date': '2003', 'HD': 'LEGACY HOTELS REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUST\\nFinancial Snapshot', 'WC': '172 words', 'PD': '17 April 2003', 'SN': 'The Globe and Mail Report on Business Financial Snapshot', 'SC': 'ROBFS', 'LA': 'English', 'CY': 'All material copyright Bell Globemedia Publishing Inc. and its licensors.

Year to date, the REIT universe in Canada is down 14 per cent, she said. “When interest rates rise, REITs tend to fall because investors have alternate investments to go to, such as government bonds,” she added.  \\nMichael Smith, an analyst at National Bank Financial Inc., said he also expects the second-quarter results to show a “material bounce back from an unusually hard-hit quarter last year.”  \\nUnits of Legacy rose 5 cents to close at $6.95 on the Toronto Stock Exchange.\", 'CO': 'leghot : Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust', 'IN': 'i81502 : Trusts/Funds/Financial Vehicles | i8150206 : Investment Trusts/Funds | i815020602 : Real Estate Investment Trusts | i6651 : Hotels (except Casino)/Motels | ireest : Real Estate | i66 : Hotels/Restaurants/Casinos | i665 : Lodgings | icre : Construction/Real Estate | iinv : Investing/Securities', 'NS': 'c151 : Earnings | c1512 : Dividends | ccat : Corporate/Industrial News | c15 : Performance', 'RE': 'cana : Canada | namz : North America', 'IPD': 'travel industry  | hotels  | investments  | stocks  | ROB 1000  | $LGY.UN  | Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust', 'PUB': 'Bell Globemedia Interactive', 'AN': 'Document GLOB000020040615e06f0003i'}, {'company_code': 'leghot', 'news_code': 'sfglob', 'date': '2004', 'CLM': 'REAL ESTATE', 'SE': 'Report on Business: Canadian', 'HD': 'Fairmont to reduce stake in Legacy; New accounting rules prompting sale of trust units', 'BY': 'RICHARD BLOOM', 'WC': '488 words', 'PD': '28 April 2004', 'SN': 'The Globe and Mail', 'SC': 'GLOB', 'PG': 'B7', 'LA': 'English', 'CY': 'All material copyright Bell Globemedia Publishing Inc. or its licensors.

Those same rules went into effect in the United States this year.  \\nFairmont does not have to include Legacy's results should it reduce its stake to below 25-per-cent, it said.  \\n“Fairmont believes that consolidating Legacy would complicate investors' ability to assess Fairmont's financial performance,” Legacy said in a statement.  \\nAny sale would be “subject to favourable market conditions,” the companies said.  \\nHowever, conditions for interest-rate-sensitive income trust units have been anything but favourable in recent weeks. The sector has taken a beating amid signs of improving economic conditions across North America and fears that inflation may soon climb. Rising inflation and, in turn, increasing interest rates make holding trusts less attractive, because investors can get higher rates of return on a variety of other investment vehicles.  \\nAnalysts, meanwhile, were generally positive about the possible sale. Deutsche Bank's Marc Falcone said consolidating Legacy into Fairmont's results would “unduly distort” Fairmont's financial performance and attractiveness as an investment.  \\nGoldman Sachs analyst Steven Kent agreed, saying “the close relationship between the two . . . has always caused concern with investors who questioned whether or not some of the asset dispositions were arm's-length transactions.”  \\nThe announcements came alongside weaker first-quarter results at Fairmont, which posted a loss of nearly $600,000 (U.S.) or 1 cent a share, compared with a profit of $12.5-million or 16 cents a year earlier. Sales rose slightly to $168.2-million from $167.9-million.  \\nThe news also followed an April 20 announcement from Legacy that it may sell parts of its hotel portfolio. It said it is considering unloading some of its non-core assets, such as its Delta hotels in Canada, possibly this year.

At the hotels it manages, revenue per available room rose 5 per cent. Fairmont said RevPAR continued to improve over year-earlier levels at all of its properties.  \\nOccupancy levels fell 1.3 per cent at both its owned and managed hotels.  \\nFairmont operates more than 80 hotels under the Fairmont and Delta banners, including the landmark former CP Hotels owned by Legacy.  \\nFor the full year, Fairmont earned $50.7-million or 64 cents, down 45 per cent from $92.5-million or $1.18 in 2002.

Much of our reduced performance resulted from external factors, including a weak U.S. economy, airline industry problems, and most notably, the considerable impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome,” said Neil Labatte, Legacy\\'s President and Chief Executive Officer.  \\n“Despite the challenging operating environment, improving demand trends continued to build through the fourth quarter.”  \\nFor the three months ended in December, Legacy lost $9.2-million or 12 cents a share, compared with a year-earlier profit of $7.6-million or 4 cents a share.  \\nFourth-quarter sales edged higher by 11.6 per cent to $178.9-million from $160.3-million, boosted by results from the Fairmont Washington in D.C. and August\\'s acquisition of the Fairmont Olympic Hotel in Seattle, which contributed $23.5-million.  \\nLegacy owns hotel properties mostly across Canada that are managed by Fairmont Hotels & Resorts Inc. and Delta Hotels Ltd. Its hotels include the swanky Fairmont Empress in Victoria, Fairmont Le Château Frontenac in Quebec, and Fairmont Royal York in Toronto.  \\nDuring the quarter, conditions in Quebec City and Toronto were a “challenge,” Legacy said. Sales at Le Château Frontenac were down 15 per cent from 2002 levels because of “softness in the U.S.” and weal international tour levels.  \\nSales at Legacy\\'s three Toronto hotels were down 5 per cent from year-earlier levels, but still showed significant improvement over the prior two quarters, Legacy said.  \\nOccupancies in the city have largely returned to 2002 levels, however, rates within the market remain under pressure, the trust added.  \\nCanada\\'s tourism industry was battered in 2003 and has been slow to recover after the SARS outbreak early in the year. Legacy, which suspended its distribution payments in the second quarter, has blamed the continuing effects of SARS on the industry for its struggling financial performance throughout the year.  \\nOn Tuesday that trust said only that its “objective continues to be to provide our unit holders with an appropriate level of distributions as soon as operating performance permits.\"  \\nFor fiscal 2003, Legacy lost $8.4-million or 21 cents a share on sales of $663.9-million. That compared with a profit of $55.1-million or 50 cents a share on revenues of $647.6-million in 2002.  \\nLooking ahead, Legacy said it was optimistic that tourism would bounce back this year. “The fourth quarter is traditionally a lower earnings period for Legacy, however, we are encouraged by the improving trends, which point to the anticipated strong recovery in the lodging sector in 2004,” said Mr. Labatte.  \\nGlobe and Mail Update', 'CO': 'leghot : Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust', 'IN': 'i665 : Lodgings | i6651 : Hotels (except Casino)/Motels | i66 : Hotels/Restaurants/Casinos | i81502 : Trusts/Funds/Financial Vehicles | i8150206 : Investment Trusts/Funds | i815020602 : Real Estate Investment Trusts | icre : Construction/Real Estate | iinv : Investing/Securities | ireest : Real Estate', 'RE': 'cana : Canada | namz : North America', 'IPD': 'legacy  | and  | earns', 'PUB': 'Bell Globemedia Interactive', 'AN': 'Document GMBN000020040127e01r0012x'}, {'company_code': 'leghot', 'news_code': 'sfglob', 'date': '2004', 'SE': \"Appointment Notices-Adv't\", 'HD': 'Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust', 'WC': '157 words', 'PD': '20 January 2004', 'SN': 'The Globe and Mail', 'SC': 'GLOB', 'PG': 'B6', 'LA': 'English', 'CY': 'All material copyright Bell Globemedia Publishing Inc. or its licensors.

He aims to squeeze out value with measures such as asset sales and stock buybacks.  \\nYesterday, Fairmont shares hit a 52-week high of $36.29 in New York where volume reached 3.6 million shares — nearly 10 times the annual daily average.  \\nCanadians' reaction was more low key, with shares closing at $43 (Canadian), up $1.10 on higher-than-usual volume.  \\nMr. Icahn's actions also prompted some analysts to raise stock targets and rating on Fairmont and its sister Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust, figuring his arrival will raise the stock.  \\nThis could be a nasty wakeup call for Fairmont chief executive officer William Fatt and his blue-chip board.  \\nA meeting “within the next week or two,” is in the works, company spokeswomen Denise Achonu confirmed yesterday. The time and place of that encounter is still up in the air, she said.  \\nMs. Achonu said Fairmont executives met yesterday with advisers, including lawyers and investment bankers.  \\nMr. Fatt responded to Mr. Icahn's arrival at Fairmont by saying many of the objectives he laid out are in the works. During the third quarter, the company bought back two million shares at a rate of 50,000 a day. It also has been clear about its intentions to sell its hotel properties, which include some one-of-a-kind locations, such as the Banff Springs and Jasper Park Lodge.  \\nBut there is a general feeling on the Street that Fairmont's efforts have been too little and too late.  \\nMr. Icahn is not known for his patience — or for low-key tactics. Last spring, he blasted the top brass at Blockbuster Inc. — another of his investment targets — on the company's own conference call. The operator disconnected him after six minutes of fireworks, heard by hundreds of analysts and investors.  \\nHe has used his take-no-prisoners tactics with several target companies, muscling onto corporate boards and forcing firms to spend millions buying shares.  \\nAt Time Warner Inc., were he holds a small stake, he took on management in a letter to shareholders last month, even taking a swipe at what he described as the “lavish features” of a new employee cafeteria.  \\nMichael Smith, an analyst with National Bank Financial, said he has no doubt Mr. Icahn's investment will force Mr. Fatt to shift gears. “He has got to move faster.”  \\nCanadian fund managers reached yesterday were generally supportive of the route Mr. Fatt has taken, but said they'd be pleased if Mr. Icahn's actions allowed them to realize returns sooner.  \\n“We're comfortable with the management,” said Ted Macklin, portfolio manager at Guardian Capital. “Do we want to be patient? Yes. But am I disturbed to see Carl Icahn own 9.3 per cent? No, I'm not disturbed by that.”\", 'ART': 'Illustration', 'CO': 'farmnt : Fairmont Hotels & Resorts Inc | leghot : Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust', 'IN': 'i665 : Lodgings | i6651 : Hotels (except Casino)/Motels | ireest : Real Estate | i66 : Hotels/Restaurants/Casinos | i81502 : Trusts/Funds/Financial Vehicles | i8150206 : Investment Trusts/Funds | i815020602 : Real Estate Investment Trusts | icre : Construction/Real Estate | iinv : Investing/Securities', 'NS': 'ccat : Corporate/Industrial News', 'RE': 'cana : Canada | usa : United States | caon : Ontario | namz : North America', 'IPD': 'stocks  | Carl Icahn  | ROB 1000  | $FHR  | $LGY.UN  | Fairmont Hotels &  | Resorts Inc.  | Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust', 'PUB': 'Bell Globemedia Interactive', 'AN': 'Document GLOB000020051109e1b90001r'}, {'company_code': 'leghot', 'news_code': 'sfglob', 'date': '2005', 'SE': 'Report on Business', 'HD': 'Correction', 'WC': '37 words', 'PD': '28 October 2005', 'SN': 'The Globe and Mail', 'SC': 'GLOB', 'PG': 'B2', 'LA': 'English', 'CY': 'All material copyright Bell Globemedia Publishing Inc. or its licensors.

All rights reserved.', 'LP': 'Calgary -- James Grant is one of Wall Street\\'s best-known \"bears,\" a\\nthoughtful but pessimistic watcher of markets who has found very little\\nworth buying over the past few years. In general, he says he still has a\\nhard time finding bargains, but he did take the time to single one out\\nrecently: the Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust, run by Canadian\\nPacific.\\n\\n\\nIn fact, when asked during a recent interview in The New York Times what\\nhe felt was worth buying, Mr. Grant mentioned just three things --\\nsmall-capitalization Asian stocks, gold and the Legacy REIT. He called it\\n\"a real estate investment trust with a bunch of lovely properties\" that\\nyou could buy \"for about half of book value, with a yield in the low\\nteens.\"', 'TD': 'The comments from Mr. Grant, a veteran U.S. market analyst, boosted the\\nprice of the trust units substantially. What makes his opinion even more\\ninteresting is that a year ago, when the Legacy trust was first\\nestablished, Mr. Grant was still extremely critical of the whole income\\ntrust phenomenon, which he felt was overpromoted in an almost\\nirresponsible way.\\n\\n\\nThere\\'s another interesting aspect to the recommendation of Legacy by Mr.\\nGrant, which appeared in more detail in a recent issue of his widely read\\nGrant\\'s Interest Rate Observer newsletter. Legacy was first brought to his\\nattention by long-time collaborator and fellow bear, Calgary-based\\nmerchant banker Charles (Chuck) Charlton.\\n\\n\\nMr. Charlton, who has run a boutique investment banking firm in Alberta\\nsince 1980, was also critical of the income trust frenzy when it exploded\\nlast year. In fact, it was at his urging that Mr. Grant made a speech at a\\nCanadian financial analysts\\' conference attacking the way trusts were\\nbeing marketed to retail investors by pushing high rates of return.\\n\\n\\n\"I thought it was disgusting the way the corporate finance and\\nunderwriting community was promoting these things, and I called it to his\\nattention,\" Mr. Charlton says. \"So I think he was kind of surprised when I\\ncalled him about Legacy and suggested he have a look at it.\" In his\\nOctober newsletter, Mr. Grant gives Mr. Charlton credit for drawing his\\nattention to the REIT.\\n\\n\\nIn his commentary, Mr. Grant says \"the search for a safe and sane high\\nyield\" in North America \"resembles the search for a vacant parking spot on\\nthe streets of midtown Manhattan: If you find it, there must be something\\nwrong with it.\" Attracted by Legacy\\'s high yield of about 14 per cent, Mr.\\nGrant says he \"tried to find out what\\'s wrong with it.\"\\n\\n\\nHowever, after reviewing the portfolio -- which includes some of CP\\'s\\nbest executive hotels (although not the crown jewels, such as Banff\\nSprings) -- and going over the trust\\'s balance sheet, Mr. Grant comes as\\nclose as he ever does to a \"buy\" rating, saying \"we have arrived at a\\nbullish conclusion: The potential upside outweighs the likely downside.\"\\n\\n\\nAt their price at the time of $5.90, the units -- issued at $9 -- were\\ntrading for half the trust\\'s book value, with a yield of 16 per cent. The\\nunits have since risen to $7 (dropping the yield to 13 per cent), buoyed\\nnot only by Mr. Grant\\'s comments but also by the fact that all the buyers\\nwho paid using instalment receipts paid their second instalment of $4 on\\nNov. 10. CP has said it plans to buy more units, adding to its 33-per-cent\\nstake.\\n\\n\\nMr. Grant notes in his newsletter that another former critic of the trust\\n-- namely Richard Rooney, president of Toronto-based money manager\\nBurgundy Asset Management -- has also changed his mind to some extent.\\nLast year, Mr. Rooney wrote a scathing indictment of the trust phenomenon\\nand in fact singled out Legacy. But he told Mr. Grant that a yield of 12\\nto 15 per cent made him far more inclined to recommend investing in the\\nunits now.\\n\\n\\nAs for the Alberta connection in all this, Mr. Charlton says he has been\\none of Mr. Grant\\'s contacts for almost a decade, ever since a mutual\\nfriend in New York said they shared a certain perspective on the market.\\n\"Over the years I\\'ve done some background research for him on various\\nthings, whether it\\'s Ontario Hydro, or crude oil or the Canadian dollar.\"\\n\\n\\nHaving built his investment firm into a 60-person company with branches\\nin Calgary, Grande Prairie, Edmonton and Fort McMurray -- an expansion\\nstrategy he admits now was probably a mistake -- Mr. Charlton is now back\\nwhere he began. He sold the firm to Canadian Western Bank earlier this\\nyear, and now runs a small boutique that specializes in private\\nplacements.\\n\\n\\nAlthough Mr. Charlton says he has great respect for Mr. Grant, who he\\ndescribes as \"an individualistic thinker with a brilliant mind,\" that\\ndoesn\\'t mean the two agree on everything. \"Sometimes we disagree violently\\n-- we have for years on crude oil, for example. He\\'s a great bull and I\\'ve\\nbeen a great bear, but we\\'ve agreed to disagree on that one.\"\\n\\n\\nBusiness West readers can reach Mathew Ingram by fax at (403) 244-9809 or\\nby E-mail at\\nmingram@globeandmail.ca', 'CO': 'leghot : Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust', 'IN': 'i85 : Real Estate Transactions | icre : Construction/Real Estate', 'NS': 'ncat : Content Types | nedc : Commentary/Opinion', 'RE': 'caab : Alberta | cana : Canada | namz : North America | usa : United States | use : Northeast U.S. | usny : New York', 'IPC': 'LGY', 'IPD': 'Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust  | James Grant', 'AN': 'Document glob000020011205dubj01pup'}, {'company_code': 'leghot', 'news_code': 'sfglob', 'date': '1998', 'CLM': 'INVESTMENT NEWS', 'SE': 'Report on Business', 'HD': 'Legacy Hotels', 'WC': '59 words', 'PD': '12 November 1998', 'SN': 'The Globe and Mail', 'SC': 'GLOB', 'ED': 'Metro', 'PG': 'B26', 'LA': 'English', 'CY': 'All material copyright Thomson Canada Limited or its licensors.

When payments do resume, Legacy will hand out less than its total distributable profit, leaving an unspecified percentage in reserve.  \\nLegacy reported that profit fell to $17.5-million in the most recent quarter from $37.5-million during the same time last year.

In fact, in the first quarter over the past couple of years, they have reported losses.”   \\nInvestors received 18.5 cents per unit in each of the four quarters prior to the first distribution suspension.

The analyst expects the investment trust to report profit of 30 cents per unit, down from 40 cents a year earlier.   \\nNeil Labatte, Legacy's chief executive officer, said he is encouraged by early signs of recovery in the travel industry, but “current earnings continue to be below historical levels, primarily as a result of SARS.”   \\nLegacy will resume “an appropriate distribution level as soon as operating performance permits,” Mr. Labatte said. “We are cautiously optimistic with the booking pace for 2004 group business. This important customer segment is currently on pace for a strong recovery next year.”   \\nCIBC World Markets analyst Rossa O'Reilly agreed that a reinstatement of a distribution is unlikely until the second quarter of 2004. “That of course depends on what happens to the economy, travel, and world events between now and then,” he said.   \\nMr. O'Reilly said he also had anticipated suspension of the distribution for the latest quarter. “The industry is still in a very weak condition,” he said.   \\nNational Bank Financial Inc. analyst Michael Smith was a bit more optimistic.

Year to date, the REIT universe in Canada is down 14 per cent, she said. “When interest rates rise, REITs tend to fall because investors have alternate investments to go to, such as government bonds,” she added.  \\nMichael Smith, an analyst at National Bank Financial Inc., said he also expects the second-quarter results to show a “material bounce back from an unusually hard-hit quarter last year.”  \\nUnits of Legacy rose 5 cents to close at $6.95 on the Toronto Stock Exchange.\", 'CO': 'leghot : Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust', 'IN': 'i81502 : Trusts/Funds/Financial Vehicles | i8150206 : Investment Trusts/Funds | i815020602 : Real Estate Investment Trusts | i6651 : Hotels (except Casino)/Motels | ireest : Real Estate | i66 : Hotels/Restaurants/Casinos | i665 : Lodgings | icre : Construction/Real Estate | iinv : Investing/Securities', 'NS': 'c151 : Earnings | c1512 : Dividends | ccat : Corporate/Industrial News | c15 : Performance', 'RE': 'cana : Canada | namz : North America', 'IPD': 'travel industry  | hotels  | investments  | stocks  | ROB 1000  | $LGY.UN  | Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust', 'PUB': 'Bell Globemedia Interactive', 'AN': 'Document GLOB000020040615e06f0003i'}, {'company_code': 'leghot', 'news_code': 'sfglob', 'date': '2004', 'CLM': 'REAL ESTATE', 'SE': 'Report on Business: Canadian', 'HD': 'Fairmont to reduce stake in Legacy; New accounting rules prompting sale of trust units', 'BY': 'RICHARD BLOOM', 'WC': '488 words', 'PD': '28 April 2004', 'SN': 'The Globe and Mail', 'SC': 'GLOB', 'PG': 'B7', 'LA': 'English', 'CY': 'All material copyright Bell Globemedia Publishing Inc. or its licensors.

The sector has taken a beating amid signs of improving economic conditions across North America and fears that inflation may soon climb. Rising inflation and, in turn, increasing interest rates make holding trusts less attractive, because investors can get higher rates of return on a variety of other investment vehicles.  \\nAnalysts, meanwhile, were generally positive about the possible sale. Deutsche Bank's Marc Falcone said consolidating Legacy into Fairmont's results would “unduly distort” Fairmont's financial performance and attractiveness as an investment.  \\nGoldman Sachs analyst Steven Kent agreed, saying “the close relationship between the two . . . has always caused concern with investors who questioned whether or not some of the asset dispositions were arm's-length transactions.”  \\nThe announcements came alongside weaker first-quarter results at Fairmont, which posted a loss of nearly $600,000 (U.S.) or 1 cent a share, compared with a profit of $12.5-million or 16 cents a year earlier.

(That total is down from an earlier estimate of $10-million to $12-million.)  \\nFourth-quarter operating revenues rose 9.2 to $137.1-million from $125.6-million, boosted by the recent acquisitions of The Fairmont Copley Plaza in Boston and The Fairmont Orchid in Hawaii.  \\nOperating revenues from managed and franchised properties rose 9.5 per cent to $144.9-million from $132.3-million.  \\n“While the appreciation in the Canadian dollar was a key driver of increased revenues, it had a considerable impact on expenses in the fourth quarter,” Fairmont said.  \\nRevenue per available room -- an important measure of profitability for hotel operators -- rose 8.8 per cent at hotels owned by Fairmont. At the hotels it manages, revenue per available room rose 5 per cent. Fairmont said RevPAR continued to improve over year-earlier levels at all of its properties.  \\nOccupancy levels fell 1.3 per cent at both its owned and managed hotels.  \\nFairmont operates more than 80 hotels under the Fairmont and Delta banners, including the landmark former CP Hotels owned by Legacy.  \\nFor the full year, Fairmont earned $50.7-million or 64 cents, down 45 per cent from $92.5-million or $1.18 in 2002.

Much of our reduced performance resulted from external factors, including a weak U.S. economy, airline industry problems, and most notably, the considerable impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome,” said Neil Labatte, Legacy\\'s President and Chief Executive Officer.  \\n“Despite the challenging operating environment, improving demand trends continued to build through the fourth quarter.”  \\nFor the three months ended in December, Legacy lost $9.2-million or 12 cents a share, compared with a year-earlier profit of $7.6-million or 4 cents a share.  \\nFourth-quarter sales edged higher by 11.6 per cent to $178.9-million from $160.3-million, boosted by results from the Fairmont Washington in D.C. and August\\'s acquisition of the Fairmont Olympic Hotel in Seattle, which contributed $23.5-million.  \\nLegacy owns hotel properties mostly across Canada that are managed by Fairmont Hotels & Resorts Inc. and Delta Hotels Ltd. Its hotels include the swanky Fairmont Empress in Victoria, Fairmont Le Château Frontenac in Quebec, and Fairmont Royal York in Toronto.  \\nDuring the quarter, conditions in Quebec City and Toronto were a “challenge,” Legacy said. Sales at Le Château Frontenac were down 15 per cent from 2002 levels because of “softness in the U.S.” and weal international tour levels.  \\nSales at Legacy\\'s three Toronto hotels were down 5 per cent from year-earlier levels, but still showed significant improvement over the prior two quarters, Legacy said.  \\nOccupancies in the city have largely returned to 2002 levels, however, rates within the market remain under pressure, the trust added.  \\nCanada\\'s tourism industry was battered in 2003 and has been slow to recover after the SARS outbreak early in the year. Legacy, which suspended its distribution payments in the second quarter, has blamed the continuing effects of SARS on the industry for its struggling financial performance throughout the year.  \\nOn Tuesday that trust said only that its “objective continues to be to provide our unit holders with an appropriate level of distributions as soon as operating performance permits.\"  \\nFor fiscal 2003, Legacy lost $8.4-million or 21 cents a share on sales of $663.9-million. That compared with a profit of $55.1-million or 50 cents a share on revenues of $647.6-million in 2002.  \\nLooking ahead, Legacy said it was optimistic that tourism would bounce back this year. “The fourth quarter is traditionally a lower earnings period for Legacy, however, we are encouraged by the improving trends, which point to the anticipated strong recovery in the lodging sector in 2004,” said Mr. Labatte.  \\nGlobe and Mail Update', 'CO': 'leghot : Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust', 'IN': 'i665 : Lodgings | i6651 : Hotels (except Casino)/Motels | i66 : Hotels/Restaurants/Casinos | i81502 : Trusts/Funds/Financial Vehicles | i8150206 : Investment Trusts/Funds | i815020602 : Real Estate Investment Trusts | icre : Construction/Real Estate | iinv : Investing/Securities | ireest : Real Estate', 'RE': 'cana : Canada | namz : North America', 'IPD': 'legacy  | and  | earns', 'PUB': 'Bell Globemedia Interactive', 'AN': 'Document GMBN000020040127e01r0012x'}, {'company_code': 'leghot', 'news_code': 'sfglob', 'date': '2004', 'SE': \"Appointment Notices-Adv't\", 'HD': 'Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust', 'WC': '157 words', 'PD': '20 January 2004', 'SN': 'The Globe and Mail', 'SC': 'GLOB', 'PG': 'B6', 'LA': 'English', 'CY': 'All material copyright Bell Globemedia Publishing Inc. or its licensors.

He aims to squeeze out value with measures such as asset sales and stock buybacks.  \\nYesterday, Fairmont shares hit a 52-week high of $36.29 in New York where volume reached 3.6 million shares — nearly 10 times the annual daily average.  \\nCanadians' reaction was more low key, with shares closing at $43 (Canadian), up $1.10 on higher-than-usual volume.  \\nMr. Icahn's actions also prompted some analysts to raise stock targets and rating on Fairmont and its sister Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust, figuring his arrival will raise the stock.  \\nThis could be a nasty wakeup call for Fairmont chief executive officer William Fatt and his blue-chip board.  \\nA meeting “within the next week or two,” is in the works, company spokeswomen Denise Achonu confirmed yesterday. The time and place of that encounter is still up in the air, she said.  \\nMs. Achonu said Fairmont executives met yesterday with advisers, including lawyers and investment bankers.  \\nMr. Fatt responded to Mr. Icahn's arrival at Fairmont by saying many of the objectives he laid out are in the works. During the third quarter, the company bought back two million shares at a rate of 50,000 a day. It also has been clear about its intentions to sell its hotel properties, which include some one-of-a-kind locations, such as the Banff Springs and Jasper Park Lodge.  \\nBut there is a general feeling on the Street that Fairmont's efforts have been too little and too late.  \\nMr. Icahn is not known for his patience — or for low-key tactics. Last spring, he blasted the top brass at Blockbuster Inc. — another of his investment targets — on the company's own conference call. The operator disconnected him after six minutes of fireworks, heard by hundreds of analysts and investors.  \\nHe has used his take-no-prisoners tactics with several target companies, muscling onto corporate boards and forcing firms to spend millions buying shares.  \\nAt Time Warner Inc., were he holds a small stake, he took on management in a letter to shareholders last month, even taking a swipe at what he described as the “lavish features” of a new employee cafeteria.  \\nMichael Smith, an analyst with National Bank Financial, said he has no doubt Mr. Icahn's investment will force Mr. Fatt to shift gears. “He has got to move faster.”  \\nCanadian fund managers reached yesterday were generally supportive of the route Mr. Fatt has taken, but said they'd be pleased if Mr. Icahn's actions allowed them to realize returns sooner.  \\n“We're comfortable with the management,” said Ted Macklin, portfolio manager at Guardian Capital. “Do we want to be patient? Yes. But am I disturbed to see Carl Icahn own 9.3 per cent? No, I'm not disturbed by that.”\", 'ART': 'Illustration', 'CO': 'farmnt : Fairmont Hotels & Resorts Inc | leghot : Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust', 'IN': 'i665 : Lodgings | i6651 : Hotels (except Casino)/Motels | ireest : Real Estate | i66 : Hotels/Restaurants/Casinos | i81502 : Trusts/Funds/Financial Vehicles | i8150206 : Investment Trusts/Funds | i815020602 : Real Estate Investment Trusts | icre : Construction/Real Estate | iinv : Investing/Securities', 'NS': 'ccat : Corporate/Industrial News', 'RE': 'cana : Canada | usa : United States | caon : Ontario | namz : North America', 'IPD': 'stocks  | Carl Icahn  | ROB 1000  | $FHR  | $LGY.UN  | Fairmont Hotels &  | Resorts Inc.  | Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust', 'PUB': 'Bell Globemedia Interactive', 'AN': 'Document GLOB000020051109e1b90001r'}, {'company_code': 'leghot', 'news_code': 'sfglob', 'date': '2005', 'SE': 'Report on Business', 'HD': 'Correction', 'WC': '37 words', 'PD': '28 October 2005', 'SN': 'The Globe and Mail', 'SC': 'GLOB', 'PG': 'B2', 'LA': 'English', 'CY': 'All material copyright Bell Globemedia Publishing Inc. or its licensors.

All rights reserved.', 'LP': 'Calgary -- James Grant is one of Wall Street\\'s best-known \"bears,\" a\\nthoughtful but pessimistic watcher of markets who has found very little\\nworth buying over the past few years. In general, he says he still has a\\nhard time finding bargains, but he did take the time to single one out\\nrecently: the Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust, run by Canadian\\nPacific.\\n\\n\\nIn fact, when asked during a recent interview in The New York Times what\\nhe felt was worth buying, Mr. Grant mentioned just three things --\\nsmall-capitalization Asian stocks, gold and the Legacy REIT. He called it\\n\"a real estate investment trust with a bunch of lovely properties\" that\\nyou could buy \"for about half of book value, with a yield in the low\\nteens.\"', 'TD': 'The comments from Mr. Grant, a veteran U.S. market analyst, boosted the\\nprice of the trust units substantially. What makes his opinion even more\\ninteresting is that a year ago, when the Legacy trust was first\\nestablished, Mr. Grant was still extremely critical of the whole income\\ntrust phenomenon, which he felt was overpromoted in an almost\\nirresponsible way.\\n\\n\\nThere\\'s another interesting aspect to the recommendation of Legacy by Mr.\\nGrant, which appeared in more detail in a recent issue of his widely read\\nGrant\\'s Interest Rate Observer newsletter. Legacy was first brought to his\\nattention by long-time collaborator and fellow bear, Calgary-based\\nmerchant banker Charles (Chuck) Charlton.\\n\\n\\nMr. Charlton, who has run a boutique investment banking firm in Alberta\\nsince 1980, was also critical of the income trust frenzy when it exploded\\nlast year. In fact, it was at his urging that Mr. Grant made a speech at a\\nCanadian financial analysts\\' conference attacking the way trusts were\\nbeing marketed to retail investors by pushing high rates of return.\\n\\n\\n\"I thought it was disgusting the way the corporate finance and\\nunderwriting community was promoting these things, and I called it to his\\nattention,\" Mr. Charlton says. \"So I think he was kind of surprised when I\\ncalled him about Legacy and suggested he have a look at it.\" In his\\nOctober newsletter, Mr. Grant gives Mr. Charlton credit for drawing his\\nattention to the REIT.\\n\\n\\nIn his commentary, Mr. Grant says \"the search for a safe and sane high\\nyield\" in North America \"resembles the search for a vacant parking spot on\\nthe streets of midtown Manhattan: If you find it, there must be something\\nwrong with it.\" Attracted by Legacy\\'s high yield of about 14 per cent, Mr.\\nGrant says he \"tried to find out what\\'s wrong with it.\"\\n\\n\\nHowever, after reviewing the portfolio -- which includes some of CP\\'s\\nbest executive hotels (although not the crown jewels, such as Banff\\nSprings) -- and going over the trust\\'s balance sheet, Mr. Grant comes as\\nclose as he ever does to a \"buy\" rating, saying \"we have arrived at a\\nbullish conclusion: The potential upside outweighs the likely downside.\"\\n\\n\\nAt their price at the time of $5.90, the units -- issued at $9 -- were\\ntrading for half the trust\\'s book value, with a yield of 16 per cent. The\\nunits have since risen to $7 (dropping the yield to 13 per cent), buoyed\\nnot only by Mr. Grant\\'s comments but also by the fact that all the buyers\\nwho paid using instalment receipts paid their second instalment of $4 on\\nNov. 10. CP has said it plans to buy more units, adding to its 33-per-cent\\nstake.\\n\\n\\nMr. Grant notes in his newsletter that another former critic of the trust\\n-- namely Richard Rooney, president of Toronto-based money manager\\nBurgundy Asset Management -- has also changed his mind to some extent.\\nLast year, Mr. Rooney wrote a scathing indictment of the trust phenomenon\\nand in fact singled out Legacy. But he told Mr. Grant that a yield of 12\\nto 15 per cent made him far more inclined to recommend investing in the\\nunits now.\\n\\n\\nAs for the Alberta connection in all this, Mr. Charlton says he has been\\none of Mr. Grant\\'s contacts for almost a decade, ever since a mutual\\nfriend in New York said they shared a certain perspective on the market.\\n\"Over the years I\\'ve done some background research for him on various\\nthings, whether it\\'s Ontario Hydro, or crude oil or the Canadian dollar.\"\\n\\n\\nHaving built his investment firm into a 60-person company with branches\\nin Calgary, Grande Prairie, Edmonton and Fort McMurray -- an expansion\\nstrategy he admits now was probably a mistake -- Mr. Charlton is now back\\nwhere he began. He sold the firm to Canadian Western Bank earlier this\\nyear, and now runs a small boutique that specializes in private\\nplacements.\\n\\n\\nAlthough Mr. Charlton says he has great respect for Mr. Grant, who he\\ndescribes as \"an individualistic thinker with a brilliant mind,\" that\\ndoesn\\'t mean the two agree on everything. \"Sometimes we disagree violently\\n-- we have for years on crude oil, for example. He\\'s a great bull and I\\'ve\\nbeen a great bear, but we\\'ve agreed to disagree on that one.\"\\n\\n\\nBusiness West readers can reach Mathew Ingram by fax at (403) 244-9809 or\\nby E-mail at\\nmingram@globeandmail.ca', 'CO': 'leghot : Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust', 'IN': 'i85 : Real Estate Transactions | icre : Construction/Real Estate', 'NS': 'ncat : Content Types | nedc : Commentary/Opinion', 'RE': 'caab : Alberta | cana : Canada | namz : North America | usa : United States | use : Northeast U.S. | usny : New York', 'IPC': 'LGY', 'IPD': 'Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust  | James Grant', 'AN': 'Document glob000020011205dubj01pup'}, {'company_code': 'leghot', 'news_code': 'sfglob', 'date': '1998', 'CLM': 'INVESTMENT NEWS', 'SE': 'Report on Business', 'HD': 'Legacy Hotels', 'WC': '59 words', 'PD': '12 November 1998', 'SN': 'The Globe and Mail', 'SC': 'GLOB', 'ED': 'Metro', 'PG': 'B26', 'LA': 'English', 'CY': 'All material copyright Thomson Canada Limited or its licensors.

Last month, falling business prompted the REIT to announced that it would suspend distributions for the second consecutive quarter.', 'TD': 'Mr. Labatte would not speculate on when investors might see their next distribution cheque, but he did say that traditionally the hotel chain gets an idea of its business levels in the second quarter.  \\n\"We won\\'t be paying distributions until we get a clear view of the business,\" he said in an interview. When payments do resume, Legacy will hand out less than its total distributable profit, leaving an unspecified percentage in reserve.  \\nLegacy reported that profit fell to $17.5-million in the most recent quarter from $37.5-million during the same time last year. For the first nine months of the year, profit was $780,000, down from $47.5-million during the same time a year earlier.  \\nRevenue for the third quarter was $189-million, down from $194-million a year earlier.  \\nRevenue per available room — a benchmark in the industry — tumbled by 30 per cent at both Toronto\\'s Royal York and the Château Frontenac in Quebec City in the third quarter.

Legacy attributed the drop to lower occupancy levels and rates.  \\nEBITDA, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, was $48.2-million, down from $61.2-million a year earlier.  \\nShares of Legacy closed yesterday on the Toronto Stock Exchange at $6.39, off 1 cent.  \\nAlso yesterday, Legacy released the details of its recent purchase of two U.S. properties, one in Washington, D.C., and the other in Seattle.

The analyst expects the investment trust to report profit of 30 cents per unit, down from 40 cents a year earlier.   \\nNeil Labatte, Legacy's chief executive officer, said he is encouraged by early signs of recovery in the travel industry, but “current earnings continue to be below historical levels, primarily as a result of SARS.”   \\nLegacy will resume “an appropriate distribution level as soon as operating performance permits,” Mr. Labatte said. “We are cautiously optimistic with the booking pace for 2004 group business. This important customer segment is currently on pace for a strong recovery next year.”   \\nCIBC World Markets analyst Rossa O'Reilly agreed that a reinstatement of a distribution is unlikely until the second quarter of 2004. “That of course depends on what happens to the economy, travel, and world events between now and then,” he said.   \\nMr. O'Reilly said he also had anticipated suspension of the distribution for the latest quarter. “The industry is still in a very weak condition,” he said.   \\nNational Bank Financial Inc. analyst Michael Smith was a bit more optimistic.

As well, it reduced its stake in the Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust, which owns those hotels, to 24 per cent from 35 per cent, reducing its share of the REIT's income.

Year to date, the REIT universe in Canada is down 14 per cent, she said. “When interest rates rise, REITs tend to fall because investors have alternate investments to go to, such as government bonds,” she added.  \\nMichael Smith, an analyst at National Bank Financial Inc., said he also expects the second-quarter results to show a “material bounce back from an unusually hard-hit quarter last year.”  \\nUnits of Legacy rose 5 cents to close at $6.95 on the Toronto Stock Exchange.\", 'CO': 'leghot : Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust', 'IN': 'i81502 : Trusts/Funds/Financial Vehicles | i8150206 : Investment Trusts/Funds | i815020602 : Real Estate Investment Trusts | i6651 : Hotels (except Casino)/Motels | ireest : Real Estate | i66 : Hotels/Restaurants/Casinos | i665 : Lodgings | icre : Construction/Real Estate | iinv : Investing/Securities', 'NS': 'c151 : Earnings | c1512 : Dividends | ccat : Corporate/Industrial News | c15 : Performance', 'RE': 'cana : Canada | namz : North America', 'IPD': 'travel industry  | hotels  | investments  | stocks  | ROB 1000  | $LGY.UN  | Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust', 'PUB': 'Bell Globemedia Interactive', 'AN': 'Document GLOB000020040615e06f0003i'}, {'company_code': 'leghot', 'news_code': 'sfglob', 'date': '2004', 'CLM': 'REAL ESTATE', 'SE': 'Report on Business: Canadian', 'HD': 'Fairmont to reduce stake in Legacy; New accounting rules prompting sale of trust units', 'BY': 'RICHARD BLOOM', 'WC': '488 words', 'PD': '28 April 2004', 'SN': 'The Globe and Mail', 'SC': 'GLOB', 'PG': 'B7', 'LA': 'English', 'CY': 'All material copyright Bell Globemedia Publishing Inc. or its licensors.

Those same rules went into effect in the United States this year.  \\nFairmont does not have to include Legacy's results should it reduce its stake to below 25-per-cent, it said.  \\n“Fairmont believes that consolidating Legacy would complicate investors' ability to assess Fairmont's financial performance,” Legacy said in a statement.  \\nAny sale would be “subject to favourable market conditions,” the companies said.  \\nHowever, conditions for interest-rate-sensitive income trust units have been anything but favourable in recent weeks. The sector has taken a beating amid signs of improving economic conditions across North America and fears that inflation may soon climb. Rising inflation and, in turn, increasing interest rates make holding trusts less attractive, because investors can get higher rates of return on a variety of other investment vehicles.  \\nAnalysts, meanwhile, were generally positive about the possible sale. Deutsche Bank's Marc Falcone said consolidating Legacy into Fairmont's results would “unduly distort” Fairmont's financial performance and attractiveness as an investment.  \\nGoldman Sachs analyst Steven Kent agreed, saying “the close relationship between the two . . . has always caused concern with investors who questioned whether or not some of the asset dispositions were arm's-length transactions.”  \\nThe announcements came alongside weaker first-quarter results at Fairmont, which posted a loss of nearly $600,000 (U.S.) or 1 cent a share, compared with a profit of $12.5-million or 16 cents a year earlier. Sales rose slightly to $168.2-million from $167.9-million.  \\nThe news also followed an April 20 announcement from Legacy that it may sell parts of its hotel portfolio. It said it is considering unloading some of its non-core assets, such as its Delta hotels in Canada, possibly this year.

At the hotels it manages, revenue per available room rose 5 per cent.

But it failed to reinstate the dividend and did not provide a date as to when payments will begin again.', 'TD': '“This last year was undoubtedly one of the most difficult years in the Canadian hotel industry. Much of our reduced performance resulted from external factors, including a weak U.S. economy, airline industry problems, and most notably, the considerable impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome,” said Neil Labatte, Legacy\\'s President and Chief Executive Officer.  \\n“Despite the challenging operating environment, improving demand trends continued to build through the fourth quarter.”  \\nFor the three months ended in December, Legacy lost $9.2-million or 12 cents a share, compared with a year-earlier profit of $7.6-million or 4 cents a share.  \\nFourth-quarter sales edged higher by 11.6 per cent to $178.9-million from $160.3-million, boosted by results from the Fairmont Washington in D.C. and August\\'s acquisition of the Fairmont Olympic Hotel in Seattle, which contributed $23.5-million.  \\nLegacy owns hotel properties mostly across Canada that are managed by Fairmont Hotels & Resorts Inc. and Delta Hotels Ltd. Its hotels include the swanky Fairmont Empress in Victoria, Fairmont Le Château Frontenac in Quebec, and Fairmont Royal York in Toronto.  \\nDuring the quarter, conditions in Quebec City and Toronto were a “challenge,” Legacy said. Sales at Le Château Frontenac were down 15 per cent from 2002 levels because of “softness in the U.S.” and weal international tour levels.  \\nSales at Legacy\\'s three Toronto hotels were down 5 per cent from year-earlier levels, but still showed significant improvement over the prior two quarters, Legacy said.  \\nOccupancies in the city have largely returned to 2002 levels, however, rates within the market remain under pressure, the trust added.  \\nCanada\\'s tourism industry was battered in 2003 and has been slow to recover after the SARS outbreak early in the year. Legacy, which suspended its distribution payments in the second quarter, has blamed the continuing effects of SARS on the industry for its struggling financial performance throughout the year.  \\nOn Tuesday that trust said only that its “objective continues to be to provide our unit holders with an appropriate level of distributions as soon as operating performance permits.\"  \\nFor fiscal 2003, Legacy lost $8.4-million or 21 cents a share on sales of $663.9-million. That compared with a profit of $55.1-million or 50 cents a share on revenues of $647.6-million in 2002.  \\nLooking ahead, Legacy said it was optimistic that tourism would bounce back this year. “The fourth quarter is traditionally a lower earnings period for Legacy, however, we are encouraged by the improving trends, which point to the anticipated strong recovery in the lodging sector in 2004,” said Mr. Labatte.  \\nGlobe and Mail Update', 'CO': 'leghot : Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust', 'IN': 'i665 : Lodgings | i6651 : Hotels (except Casino)/Motels | i66 : Hotels/Restaurants/Casinos | i81502 : Trusts/Funds/Financial Vehicles | i8150206 : Investment Trusts/Funds | i815020602 : Real Estate Investment Trusts | icre : Construction/Real Estate | iinv : Investing/Securities | ireest : Real Estate', 'RE': 'cana : Canada | namz : North America', 'IPD': 'legacy  | and  | earns', 'PUB': 'Bell Globemedia Interactive', 'AN': 'Document GMBN000020040127e01r0012x'}, {'company_code': 'leghot', 'news_code': 'sfglob', 'date': '2004', 'SE': \"Appointment Notices-Adv't\", 'HD': 'Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust', 'WC': '157 words', 'PD': '20 January 2004', 'SN': 'The Globe and Mail', 'SC': 'GLOB', 'PG': 'B6', 'LA': 'English', 'CY': 'All material copyright Bell Globemedia Publishing Inc. or its licensors.

He aims to squeeze out value with measures such as asset sales and stock buybacks.  \\nYesterday, Fairmont shares hit a 52-week high of $36.29 in New York where volume reached 3.6 million shares — nearly 10 times the annual daily average.  \\nCanadians' reaction was more low key, with shares closing at $43 (Canadian), up $1.10 on higher-than-usual volume.  \\nMr. Icahn's actions also prompted some analysts to raise stock targets and rating on Fairmont and its sister Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust, figuring his arrival will raise the stock.  \\nThis could be a nasty wakeup call for Fairmont chief executive officer William Fatt and his blue-chip board.  \\nA meeting “within the next week or two,” is in the works, company spokeswomen Denise Achonu confirmed yesterday. The time and place of that encounter is still up in the air, she said.  \\nMs. Achonu said Fairmont executives met yesterday with advisers, including lawyers and investment bankers.  \\nMr. Fatt responded to Mr. Icahn's arrival at Fairmont by saying many of the objectives he laid out are in the works. During the third quarter, the company bought back two million shares at a rate of 50,000 a day. It also has been clear about its intentions to sell its hotel properties, which include some one-of-a-kind locations, such as the Banff Springs and Jasper Park Lodge.  \\nBut there is a general feeling on the Street that Fairmont's efforts have been too little and too late.  \\nMr. Icahn is not known for his patience — or for low-key tactics. Last spring, he blasted the top brass at Blockbuster Inc. — another of his investment targets — on the company's own conference call. The operator disconnected him after six minutes of fireworks, heard by hundreds of analysts and investors.  \\nHe has used his take-no-prisoners tactics with several target companies, muscling onto corporate boards and forcing firms to spend millions buying shares.  \\nAt Time Warner Inc., were he holds a small stake, he took on management in a letter to shareholders last month, even taking a swipe at what he described as the “lavish features” of a new employee cafeteria.  \\nMichael Smith, an analyst with National Bank Financial, said he has no doubt Mr. Icahn's investment will force Mr. Fatt to shift gears. “He has got to move faster.”  \\nCanadian fund managers reached yesterday were generally supportive of the route Mr. Fatt has taken, but said they'd be pleased if Mr. Icahn's actions allowed them to realize returns sooner.  \\n“We're comfortable with the management,” said Ted Macklin, portfolio manager at Guardian Capital. “Do we want to be patient? Yes. But am I disturbed to see Carl Icahn own 9.3 per cent?

The question now is what they want to do with their units.', 'TD': \"“My gut is that you had an entirely new shareholder base enter the stock once it announced it was pursuing strategic alternatives,” said one hedge fund manager. “Several U.S. hedge funds and other non-dedicated real estate funds entered. There were expectations as high as a possible $17 bid. Now having suffered a loss, I don't think this is an attractive [arbitrage situation] for anyone. Hence, the massive volume traded.”   \\nLegacy plunged Monday after the luxury hotel owner said offers were coming in at about $2.4-billion, as much as $580-million below expectations.   \\nA $12.60-a-unit offer would put Legacy's enterprise value at about $2.4-billion, while a $17-a-unit offer would have valued it at about $2.98-billion. The units rose 16 cents to $12.45 yesterday, suggesting some doubt about a deal emerging at $12.60.   \\nSome analysts are recommending that unitholders turn down such an offer.   \\n“We believe that offers for the REIT in the $12.60 range do not reflect enough of a premium for unitholders to give up the future earnings growth potential of Legacy and that the best plan of action at this time is the continuation of the current business plan,” Canaccord Adams analysts Jonathan Kelcher and John Travaglini stated in a report.   \\nHowever, others believe a motivated seller and buyers mean the deal will go through. Legacy and other Canadian hotel REITs are facing the end of their tax-exempt status in 2011, and their assets are highly prized by buyers including private equity and pension funds.   \\nThe Ontario Municipal Employees Pension Fund purchased seven Fairmont hotels last year, for example, and is seen as a potential bidder for Legacy. Recent media reports have also suggested Tel Aviv-based real estate investor  Gazit-Globe Ltd. and privately held North American hotel owner Westmont Hospitality Group could be among those interested in Legacy.   \\nReal estate analysts have cited Legacy's “cumbersome” long-term management contracts with its largest shareholder, Fairmont Hotels and Resorts Inc., as part of the drag on its sale value. Macroeconomic factors, particularly the 0.60-percentage-point increase in bond yields since Legacy put itself up for sale on March 1, may also have put downward pressure on the price.   \\n“Looking forward, we believe elevated bond yields could shorten the REIT M&A window of opportunity, although anecdotal evidence suggests demand for high-quality hotel real estate remains relatively sound,” Mario Saric, an analyst at Scotia Capital, said in a research note. “Despite a strategic review process which has potentially yielded less robust results than had been previously expected, we continue to believe a portfolio sale remains more likely than not.”\", 'ART': 'Illustration', 'CO': 'leghot : Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust', 'IN': 'i81502 : Trusts/Funds/Financial Vehicles | i6651 : Hotels (except Casino)/Motels | ireest : Real Estate | i66 : Hotels/Restaurants/Casinos | i665 : Lodgings | icre : Construction/Real Estate | iinv : Investing/Securities | ilea : Leisure/Arts | itourm : Tourism | i8150206 : Investment Trusts/Funds | i815020602 : Real Estate Investment Trusts', 'NS': 'ccat : Corporate/Industrial News', 'RE': 'cana : Canada | namz : North America', 'IPD': 'real estate | investment trusts | investments | ROB 1000 | $LGY.UN | Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust', 'PUB': 'The Globe and Mail Division of Bell Globemedia Publishing Inc.', 'AN': 'Document GLOB000020070620e36k00055'}, {'company_code': 'leghot', 'news_code': 'sfglob', 'date': '2007', 'CLM': 'REAL ESTATE', 'SE': 'Report on Business: Canadian', 'HD': 'Legacy bids fall short, unit price retreats', 'BY': 'LORI McLEOD', 'CR': 'REAL ESTATE REPORTER', 'WC': '370 words', 'PD': '19 June 2007', 'SN': 'The Globe and Mail', 'SC': 'GLOB', 'LA': 'English', 'CY': '2007 CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc.

What makes his opinion even more\\ninteresting is that a year ago, when the Legacy trust was first\\nestablished, Mr. Grant was still extremely critical of the whole income\\ntrust phenomenon, which he felt was overpromoted in an almost\\nirresponsible way.\\n\\n\\nThere\\'s another interesting aspect to the recommendation of Legacy by Mr.\\nGrant, which appeared in more detail in a recent issue of his widely read\\nGrant\\'s Interest Rate Observer newsletter. Legacy was first brought to his\\nattention by long-time collaborator and fellow bear, Calgary-based\\nmerchant banker Charles (Chuck) Charlton.\\n\\n\\nMr. Charlton, who has run a boutique investment banking firm in Alberta\\nsince 1980, was also critical of the income trust frenzy when it exploded\\nlast year. In fact, it was at his urging that Mr. Grant made a speech at a\\nCanadian financial analysts\\' conference attacking the way trusts were\\nbeing marketed to retail investors by pushing high rates of return.\\n\\n\\n\"I thought it was disgusting the way the corporate finance and\\nunderwriting community was promoting these things, and I called it to his\\nattention,\" Mr. Charlton says. \"So I think he was kind of surprised when I\\ncalled him about Legacy and suggested he have a look at it.\" In his\\nOctober newsletter, Mr. Grant gives Mr. Charlton credit for drawing his\\nattention to the REIT.\\n\\n\\nIn his commentary, Mr. Grant says \"the search for a safe and sane high\\nyield\" in North America \"resembles the search for a vacant parking spot on\\nthe streets of midtown Manhattan: If you find it, there must be something\\nwrong with it.\" Attracted by Legacy\\'s high yield of about 14 per cent, Mr.\\nGrant says he \"tried to find out what\\'s wrong with it.\"\\n\\n\\nHowever, after reviewing the portfolio -- which includes some of CP\\'s\\nbest executive hotels (although not the crown jewels, such as Banff\\nSprings) -- and going over the trust\\'s balance sheet, Mr. Grant comes as\\nclose as he ever does to a \"buy\" rating, saying \"we have arrived at a\\nbullish conclusion: The potential upside outweighs the likely downside.\"\\n\\n\\nAt their price at the time of $5.90, the units -- issued at $9 -- were\\ntrading for half the trust\\'s book value, with a yield of 16 per cent. The\\nunits have since risen to $7 (dropping the yield to 13 per cent), buoyed\\nnot only by Mr. Grant\\'s comments but also by the fact that all the buyers\\nwho paid using instalment receipts paid their second instalment of $4 on\\nNov. 10. CP has said it plans to buy more units, adding to its 33-per-cent\\nstake.\\n\\n\\nMr. Grant notes in his newsletter that another former critic of the trust\\n-- namely Richard Rooney, president of Toronto-based money manager\\nBurgundy Asset Management -- has also changed his mind to some extent.\\nLast year, Mr. Rooney wrote a scathing indictment of the trust phenomenon\\nand in fact singled out Legacy. But he told Mr. Grant that a yield of 12\\nto 15 per cent made him far more inclined to recommend investing in the\\nunits now.\\n\\n\\nAs for the Alberta connection in all this, Mr. Charlton says he has been\\none of Mr. Grant\\'s contacts for almost a decade, ever since a mutual\\nfriend in New York said they shared a certain perspective on the market.\\n\"Over the years I\\'ve done some background research for him on various\\nthings, whether it\\'s Ontario Hydro, or crude oil or the Canadian dollar.\"\\n\\n\\nHaving built his investment firm into a 60-person company with branches\\nin Calgary, Grande Prairie, Edmonton and Fort McMurray -- an expansion\\nstrategy he admits now was probably a mistake -- Mr. Charlton is now back\\nwhere he began. He sold the firm to Canadian Western Bank earlier this\\nyear, and now runs a small boutique that specializes in private\\nplacements.\\n\\n\\nAlthough Mr. Charlton says he has great respect for Mr. Grant, who he\\ndescribes as \"an individualistic thinker with a brilliant mind,\" that\\ndoesn\\'t mean the two agree on everything. \"Sometimes we disagree violently\\n-- we have for years on crude oil, for example. He\\'s a great bull and I\\'ve\\nbeen a great bear, but we\\'ve agreed to disagree on that one.\"\\n\\n\\nBusiness West readers can reach Mathew Ingram by fax at (403) 244-9809 or\\nby E-mail at\\nmingram@globeandmail.ca', 'CO': 'leghot : Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust', 'IN': 'i85 : Real Estate Transactions | icre : Construction/Real Estate', 'NS': 'ncat : Content Types | nedc : Commentary/Opinion', 'RE': 'caab : Alberta | cana : Canada | namz : North America | usa : United States | use : Northeast U.S. | usny : New York', 'IPC': 'LGY', 'IPD': 'Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust  | James Grant', 'AN': 'Document glob000020011205dubj01pup'}, {'company_code': 'leghot', 'news_code': 'sfglob', 'date': '1998', 'CLM': 'INVESTMENT NEWS', 'SE': 'Report on Business', 'HD': 'Legacy Hotels', 'WC': '59 words', 'PD': '12 November 1998', 'SN': 'The Globe and Mail', 'SC': 'GLOB', 'ED': 'Metro', 'PG': 'B26', 'LA': 'English', 'CY': 'All material copyright Thomson Canada Limited or its licensors.

When payments do resume, Legacy will hand out less than its total distributable profit, leaving an unspecified percentage in reserve.  \\nLegacy reported that profit fell to $17.5-million in the most recent quarter from $37.5-million during the same time last year. For the first nine months of the year, profit was $780,000, down from $47.5-million during the same time a year earlier.  \\nRevenue for the third quarter was $189-million, down from $194-million a year earlier.  \\nRevenue per available room — a benchmark in the industry — tumbled by 30 per cent at both Toronto\\'s Royal York and the Château Frontenac in Quebec City in the third quarter. It was down more than 15 per cent for the entire chain. Legacy attributed the drop to lower occupancy levels and rates.  \\nEBITDA, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, was $48.2-million, down from $61.2-million a year earlier.  \\nShares of Legacy closed yesterday on the Toronto Stock Exchange at $6.39, off 1 cent.  \\nAlso yesterday, Legacy released the details of its recent purchase of two U.S. properties, one in Washington, D.C., and the other in Seattle.

In fact, in the first quarter over the past couple of years, they have reported losses.”   \\nInvestors received 18.5 cents per unit in each of the four quarters prior to the first distribution suspension. At that time, Legacy said a combination of factors ranging from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) to a sluggish U.S. economy and trouble in the airline industry had taken their toll on the hotel business.   \\nMs. Mifsud expected Legacy to suspend its third-quarter distribution, saying it makes sense for the trust to do so or it would have had to go to the capital or debt markets to finance its $19.5-million payout.   \\nToronto-based Legacy plans to release its third-quarter results on Oct. 20. The analyst expects the investment trust to report profit of 30 cents per unit, down from 40 cents a year earlier.   \\nNeil Labatte, Legacy's chief executive officer, said he is encouraged by early signs of recovery in the travel industry, but “current earnings continue to be below historical levels, primarily as a result of SARS.”   \\nLegacy will resume “an appropriate distribution level as soon as operating performance permits,” Mr. Labatte said. “We are cautiously optimistic with the booking pace for 2004 group business. This important customer segment is currently on pace for a strong recovery next year.”   \\nCIBC World Markets analyst Rossa O'Reilly agreed that a reinstatement of a distribution is unlikely until the second quarter of 2004. “That of course depends on what happens to the economy, travel, and world events between now and then,” he said.   \\nMr. O'Reilly said he also had anticipated suspension of the distribution for the latest quarter. “The industry is still in a very weak condition,” he said.   \\nNational Bank Financial Inc. analyst Michael Smith was a bit more optimistic.

Year to date, the REIT universe in Canada is down 14 per cent, she said. “When interest rates rise, REITs tend to fall because investors have alternate investments to go to, such as government bonds,” she added.  \\nMichael Smith, an analyst at National Bank Financial Inc., said he also expects the second-quarter results to show a “material bounce back from an unusually hard-hit quarter last year.”  \\nUnits of Legacy rose 5 cents to close at $6.95 on the Toronto Stock Exchange.\", 'CO': 'leghot : Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust', 'IN': 'i81502 : Trusts/Funds/Financial Vehicles | i8150206 : Investment Trusts/Funds | i815020602 : Real Estate Investment Trusts | i6651 : Hotels (except Casino)/Motels | ireest : Real Estate | i66 : Hotels/Restaurants/Casinos | i665 : Lodgings | icre : Construction/Real Estate | iinv : Investing/Securities', 'NS': 'c151 : Earnings | c1512 : Dividends | ccat : Corporate/Industrial News | c15 : Performance', 'RE': 'cana : Canada | namz : North America', 'IPD': 'travel industry  | hotels  | investments  | stocks  | ROB 1000  | $LGY.UN  | Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust', 'PUB': 'Bell Globemedia Interactive', 'AN': 'Document GLOB000020040615e06f0003i'}, {'company_code': 'leghot', 'news_code': 'sfglob', 'date': '2004', 'CLM': 'REAL ESTATE', 'SE': 'Report on Business: Canadian', 'HD': 'Fairmont to reduce stake in Legacy; New accounting rules prompting sale of trust units', 'BY': 'RICHARD BLOOM', 'WC': '488 words', 'PD': '28 April 2004', 'SN': 'The Globe and Mail', 'SC': 'GLOB', 'PG': 'B7', 'LA': 'English', 'CY': 'All material copyright Bell Globemedia Publishing Inc. or its licensors.

The sector has taken a beating amid signs of improving economic conditions across North America and fears that inflation may soon climb. Rising inflation and, in turn, increasing interest rates make holding trusts less attractive, because investors can get higher rates of return on a variety of other investment vehicles.  \\nAnalysts, meanwhile, were generally positive about the possible sale. Deutsche Bank's Marc Falcone said consolidating Legacy into Fairmont's results would “unduly distort” Fairmont's financial performance and attractiveness as an investment.  \\nGoldman Sachs analyst Steven Kent agreed, saying “the close relationship between the two . . . has always caused concern with investors who questioned whether or not some of the asset dispositions were arm's-length transactions.”  \\nThe announcements came alongside weaker first-quarter results at Fairmont, which posted a loss of nearly $600,000 (U.S.) or 1 cent a share, compared with a profit of $12.5-million or 16 cents a year earlier.

(That total is down from an earlier estimate of $10-million to $12-million.)  \\nFourth-quarter operating revenues rose 9.2 to $137.1-million from $125.6-million, boosted by the recent acquisitions of The Fairmont Copley Plaza in Boston and The Fairmont Orchid in Hawaii.  \\nOperating revenues from managed and franchised properties rose 9.5 per cent to $144.9-million from $132.3-million.  \\n“While the appreciation in the Canadian dollar was a key driver of increased revenues, it had a considerable impact on expenses in the fourth quarter,” Fairmont said.  \\nRevenue per available room -- an important measure of profitability for hotel operators -- rose 8.8 per cent at hotels owned by Fairmont. At the hotels it manages, revenue per available room rose 5 per cent. Fairmont said RevPAR continued to improve over year-earlier levels at all of its properties.  \\nOccupancy levels fell 1.3 per cent at both its owned and managed hotels.  \\nFairmont operates more than 80 hotels under the Fairmont and Delta banners, including the landmark former CP Hotels owned by Legacy.  \\nFor the full year, Fairmont earned $50.7-million or 64 cents, down 45 per cent from $92.5-million or $1.18 in 2002.

Much of our reduced performance resulted from external factors, including a weak U.S. economy, airline industry problems, and most notably, the considerable impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome,” said Neil Labatte, Legacy\\'s President and Chief Executive Officer.  \\n“Despite the challenging operating environment, improving demand trends continued to build through the fourth quarter.”  \\nFor the three months ended in December, Legacy lost $9.2-million or 12 cents a share, compared with a year-earlier profit of $7.6-million or 4 cents a share.  \\nFourth-quarter sales edged higher by 11.6 per cent to $178.9-million from $160.3-million, boosted by results from the Fairmont Washington in D.C. and August\\'s acquisition of the Fairmont Olympic Hotel in Seattle, which contributed $23.5-million.  \\nLegacy owns hotel properties mostly across Canada that are managed by Fairmont Hotels & Resorts Inc. and Delta Hotels Ltd. Its hotels include the swanky Fairmont Empress in Victoria, Fairmont Le Château Frontenac in Quebec, and Fairmont Royal York in Toronto.  \\nDuring the quarter, conditions in Quebec City and Toronto were a “challenge,” Legacy said. Sales at Le Château Frontenac were down 15 per cent from 2002 levels because of “softness in the U.S.” and weal international tour levels.  \\nSales at Legacy\\'s three Toronto hotels were down 5 per cent from year-earlier levels, but still showed significant improvement over the prior two quarters, Legacy said.  \\nOccupancies in the city have largely returned to 2002 levels, however, rates within the market remain under pressure, the trust added.  \\nCanada\\'s tourism industry was battered in 2003 and has been slow to recover after the SARS outbreak early in the year. Legacy, which suspended its distribution payments in the second quarter, has blamed the continuing effects of SARS on the industry for its struggling financial performance throughout the year.  \\nOn Tuesday that trust said only that its “objective continues to be to provide our unit holders with an appropriate level of distributions as soon as operating performance permits.\"  \\nFor fiscal 2003, Legacy lost $8.4-million or 21 cents a share on sales of $663.9-million. That compared with a profit of $55.1-million or 50 cents a share on revenues of $647.6-million in 2002.  \\nLooking ahead, Legacy said it was optimistic that tourism would bounce back this year. “The fourth quarter is traditionally a lower earnings period for Legacy, however, we are encouraged by the improving trends, which point to the anticipated strong recovery in the lodging sector in 2004,” said Mr. Labatte.  \\nGlobe and Mail Update', 'CO': 'leghot : Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust', 'IN': 'i665 : Lodgings | i6651 : Hotels (except Casino)/Motels | i66 : Hotels/Restaurants/Casinos | i81502 : Trusts/Funds/Financial Vehicles | i8150206 : Investment Trusts/Funds | i815020602 : Real Estate Investment Trusts | icre : Construction/Real Estate | iinv : Investing/Securities | ireest : Real Estate', 'RE': 'cana : Canada | namz : North America', 'IPD': 'legacy  | and  | earns', 'PUB': 'Bell Globemedia Interactive', 'AN': 'Document GMBN000020040127e01r0012x'}, {'company_code': 'leghot', 'news_code': 'sfglob', 'date': '2004', 'SE': \"Appointment Notices-Adv't\", 'HD': 'Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust', 'WC': '157 words', 'PD': '20 January 2004', 'SN': 'The Globe and Mail', 'SC': 'GLOB', 'PG': 'B6', 'LA': 'English', 'CY': 'All material copyright Bell Globemedia Publishing Inc. or its licensors.

He aims to squeeze out value with measures such as asset sales and stock buybacks.  \\nYesterday, Fairmont shares hit a 52-week high of $36.29 in New York where volume reached 3.6 million shares — nearly 10 times the annual daily average.  \\nCanadians' reaction was more low key, with shares closing at $43 (Canadian), up $1.10 on higher-than-usual volume.  \\nMr. Icahn's actions also prompted some analysts to raise stock targets and rating on Fairmont and its sister Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust, figuring his arrival will raise the stock.  \\nThis could be a nasty wakeup call for Fairmont chief executive officer William Fatt and his blue-chip board.  \\nA meeting “within the next week or two,” is in the works, company spokeswomen Denise Achonu confirmed yesterday. The time and place of that encounter is still up in the air, she said.  \\nMs. Achonu said Fairmont executives met yesterday with advisers, including lawyers and investment bankers.  \\nMr. Fatt responded to Mr. Icahn's arrival at Fairmont by saying many of the objectives he laid out are in the works. During the third quarter, the company bought back two million shares at a rate of 50,000 a day. It also has been clear about its intentions to sell its hotel properties, which include some one-of-a-kind locations, such as the Banff Springs and Jasper Park Lodge.  \\nBut there is a general feeling on the Street that Fairmont's efforts have been too little and too late.  \\nMr. Icahn is not known for his patience — or for low-key tactics. Last spring, he blasted the top brass at Blockbuster Inc. — another of his investment targets — on the company's own conference call. The operator disconnected him after six minutes of fireworks, heard by hundreds of analysts and investors.  \\nHe has used his take-no-prisoners tactics with several target companies, muscling onto corporate boards and forcing firms to spend millions buying shares.  \\nAt Time Warner Inc., were he holds a small stake, he took on management in a letter to shareholders last month, even taking a swipe at what he described as the “lavish features” of a new employee cafeteria.  \\nMichael Smith, an analyst with National Bank Financial, said he has no doubt Mr. Icahn's investment will force Mr. Fatt to shift gears. “He has got to move faster.”  \\nCanadian fund managers reached yesterday were generally supportive of the route Mr. Fatt has taken, but said they'd be pleased if Mr. Icahn's actions allowed them to realize returns sooner.  \\n“We're comfortable with the management,” said Ted Macklin, portfolio manager at Guardian Capital. “Do we want to be patient? Yes. But am I disturbed to see Carl Icahn own 9.3 per cent? No, I'm not disturbed by that.”\", 'ART': 'Illustration', 'CO': 'farmnt : Fairmont Hotels & Resorts Inc | leghot : Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust', 'IN': 'i665 : Lodgings | i6651 : Hotels (except Casino)/Motels | ireest : Real Estate | i66 : Hotels/Restaurants/Casinos | i81502 : Trusts/Funds/Financial Vehicles | i8150206 : Investment Trusts/Funds | i815020602 : Real Estate Investment Trusts | icre : Construction/Real Estate | iinv : Investing/Securities', 'NS': 'ccat : Corporate/Industrial News', 'RE': 'cana : Canada | usa : United States | caon : Ontario | namz : North America', 'IPD': 'stocks  | Carl Icahn  | ROB 1000  | $FHR  | $LGY.UN  | Fairmont Hotels &  | Resorts Inc.  | Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust', 'PUB': 'Bell Globemedia Interactive', 'AN': 'Document GLOB000020051109e1b90001r'}, {'company_code': 'leghot', 'news_code': 'sfglob', 'date': '2005', 'SE': 'Report on Business', 'HD': 'Correction', 'WC': '37 words', 'PD': '28 October 2005', 'SN': 'The Globe and Mail', 'SC': 'GLOB', 'PG': 'B2', 'LA': 'English', 'CY': 'All material copyright Bell Globemedia Publishing Inc. or its licensors.

The question now is what they want to do with their units.', 'TD': \"“My gut is that you had an entirely new shareholder base enter the stock once it announced it was pursuing strategic alternatives,” said one hedge fund manager. “Several U.S. hedge funds and other non-dedicated real estate funds entered. There were expectations as high as a possible $17 bid. Now having suffered a loss, I don't think this is an attractive [arbitrage situation] for anyone. Hence, the massive volume traded.”   \\nLegacy plunged Monday after the luxury hotel owner said offers were coming in at about $2.4-billion, as much as $580-million below expectations.   \\nA $12.60-a-unit offer would put Legacy's enterprise value at about $2.4-billion, while a $17-a-unit offer would have valued it at about $2.98-billion. The units rose 16 cents to $12.45 yesterday, suggesting some doubt about a deal emerging at $12.60.   \\nSome analysts are recommending that unitholders turn down such an offer.   \\n“We believe that offers for the REIT in the $12.60 range do not reflect enough of a premium for unitholders to give up the future earnings growth potential of Legacy and that the best plan of action at this time is the continuation of the current business plan,” Canaccord Adams analysts Jonathan Kelcher and John Travaglini stated in a report.   \\nHowever, others believe a motivated seller and buyers mean the deal will go through. Legacy and other Canadian hotel REITs are facing the end of their tax-exempt status in 2011, and their assets are highly prized by buyers including private equity and pension funds.   \\nThe Ontario Municipal Employees Pension Fund purchased seven Fairmont hotels last year, for example, and is seen as a potential bidder for Legacy. Recent media reports have also suggested Tel Aviv-based real estate investor  Gazit-Globe Ltd. and privately held North American hotel owner Westmont Hospitality Group could be among those interested in Legacy.   \\nReal estate analysts have cited Legacy's “cumbersome” long-term management contracts with its largest shareholder, Fairmont Hotels and Resorts Inc., as part of the drag on its sale value. Macroeconomic factors, particularly the 0.60-percentage-point increase in bond yields since Legacy put itself up for sale on March 1, may also have put downward pressure on the price.   \\n“Looking forward, we believe elevated bond yields could shorten the REIT M&A window of opportunity, although anecdotal evidence suggests demand for high-quality hotel real estate remains relatively sound,” Mario Saric, an analyst at Scotia Capital, said in a research note. “Despite a strategic review process which has potentially yielded less robust results than had been previously expected, we continue to believe a portfolio sale remains more likely than not.”\", 'ART': 'Illustration', 'CO': 'leghot : Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust', 'IN': 'i81502 : Trusts/Funds/Financial Vehicles | i6651 : Hotels (except Casino)/Motels | ireest : Real Estate | i66 : Hotels/Restaurants/Casinos | i665 : Lodgings | icre : Construction/Real Estate | iinv : Investing/Securities | ilea : Leisure/Arts | itourm : Tourism | i8150206 : Investment Trusts/Funds | i815020602 : Real Estate Investment Trusts', 'NS': 'ccat : Corporate/Industrial News', 'RE': 'cana : Canada | namz : North America', 'IPD': 'real estate | investment trusts | investments | ROB 1000 | $LGY.UN | Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust', 'PUB': 'The Globe and Mail Division of Bell Globemedia Publishing Inc.', 'AN': 'Document GLOB000020070620e36k00055'}, {'company_code': 'leghot', 'news_code': 'sfglob', 'date': '2007', 'CLM': 'REAL ESTATE', 'SE': 'Report on Business: Canadian', 'HD': 'Legacy bids fall short, unit price retreats', 'BY': 'LORI McLEOD', 'CR': 'REAL ESTATE REPORTER', 'WC': '370 words', 'PD': '19 June 2007', 'SN': 'The Globe and Mail', 'SC': 'GLOB', 'LA': 'English', 'CY': '2007 CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc.

Even before yesterday's jump, its units were considered by many analysts to be trading with a takeover premium built into their price.   \\nEven so, given the amount of money now chasing property deals and the increased interest in the hotel sector, several analysts yesterday said it is hard to say just what price Legacy's portfolio may fetch.   \\n“Anything can happen in this environment,” said Michael Smith, an analyst who follows the company for National Bank Financial.   \\nLast year, a record $3-billion in hotel properties traded hands in Canada, up 73 per cent from 2005, according to research from Colliers International Hotels. Among those deals was the $1.5-billion (U.S.) sale of seven hotels to the Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement Board by Fairmont and the sale of Intrawest Corp. to private equity firm Fortress Investment Group.   \\nThis year there is already one major portfolio on the market — five Westin Hotels — that has attracted a wide range of interest, says the company that is marketing that deal.   \\nOther market observers say the list of potential Legacy portfolio buyers will likely include private equity firms, pension plans and possibly U.S. public companies. The portfolio is expected to attract global interest as an increasing number of institutional players look to gain more exposure to the hotel sector.   \\n“This is a positive step by management and the board and a positive event for investors,” said Raymond James analyst Gail Mifsud, who has a ‘strong buy' recommendation on the stock.   \\nMs. Mifsud said with its downtown locations in major cities, she believes there is “no doubt” that there is underlying value in the company. “The real estate is second to none,” she said.   \\nMr. Smith said the 50-year management contracts that the Fairmont hotels in the portfolio carry could be a drawback for some potential buyers. “They are unusually long and generous,” he said.   \\nAs well, he said the hotels run under the Delta banner and the one Sheraton hotel may not attract the same price as those operated under the Fairmont name.   \\nOthers expressed concern Canadian investors may be about to lose yet another major hotel company from the public markets. In the space of one year, Fairmont, Four Seasons Hotels Inc. and Intrawest have all been taken private or are on their way to going there.   \\nLegacy has hired Morgan Stanley and RBC Dominion Securities Inc. as its financial advisers and Ogilvy Renault as its legal counsel.   \\nCORRECTION   \\nSaturday, March 3, 2007   \\nLegacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust has retained Blake Cassels & Graydon LLP as the company's legal advisers for its strategic review.

All rights reserved.', 'LP': 'Calgary -- James Grant is one of Wall Street\\'s best-known \"bears,\" a\\nthoughtful but pessimistic watcher of markets who has found very little\\nworth buying over the past few years. In general, he says he still has a\\nhard time finding bargains, but he did take the time to single one out\\nrecently: the Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust, run by Canadian\\nPacific.\\n\\n\\nIn fact, when asked during a recent interview in The New York Times what\\nhe felt was worth buying, Mr. Grant mentioned just three things --\\nsmall-capitalization Asian stocks, gold and the Legacy REIT. He called it\\n\"a real estate investment trust with a bunch of lovely properties\" that\\nyou could buy \"for about half of book value, with a yield in the low\\nteens.\"', 'TD': 'The comments from Mr. Grant, a veteran U.S. market analyst, boosted the\\nprice of the trust units substantially. What makes his opinion even more\\ninteresting is that a year ago, when the Legacy trust was first\\nestablished, Mr. Grant was still extremely critical of the whole income\\ntrust phenomenon, which he felt was overpromoted in an almost\\nirresponsible way.\\n\\n\\nThere\\'s another interesting aspect to the recommendation of Legacy by Mr.\\nGrant, which appeared in more detail in a recent issue of his widely read\\nGrant\\'s Interest Rate Observer newsletter. Legacy was first brought to his\\nattention by long-time collaborator and fellow bear, Calgary-based\\nmerchant banker Charles (Chuck) Charlton.\\n\\n\\nMr. Charlton, who has run a boutique investment banking firm in Alberta\\nsince 1980, was also critical of the income trust frenzy when it exploded\\nlast year. In fact, it was at his urging that Mr. Grant made a speech at a\\nCanadian financial analysts\\' conference attacking the way trusts were\\nbeing marketed to retail investors by pushing high rates of return.\\n\\n\\n\"I thought it was disgusting the way the corporate finance and\\nunderwriting community was promoting these things, and I called it to his\\nattention,\" Mr. Charlton says. \"So I think he was kind of surprised when I\\ncalled him about Legacy and suggested he have a look at it.\" In his\\nOctober newsletter, Mr. Grant gives Mr. Charlton credit for drawing his\\nattention to the REIT.\\n\\n\\nIn his commentary, Mr. Grant says \"the search for a safe and sane high\\nyield\" in North America \"resembles the search for a vacant parking spot on\\nthe streets of midtown Manhattan: If you find it, there must be something\\nwrong with it.\" Attracted by Legacy\\'s high yield of about 14 per cent, Mr.\\nGrant says he \"tried to find out what\\'s wrong with it.\"\\n\\n\\nHowever, after reviewing the portfolio -- which includes some of CP\\'s\\nbest executive hotels (although not the crown jewels, such as Banff\\nSprings) -- and going over the trust\\'s balance sheet, Mr. Grant comes as\\nclose as he ever does to a \"buy\" rating, saying \"we have arrived at a\\nbullish conclusion: The potential upside outweighs the likely downside.\"\\n\\n\\nAt their price at the time of $5.90, the units -- issued at $9 -- were\\ntrading for half the trust\\'s book value, with a yield of 16 per cent. The\\nunits have since risen to $7 (dropping the yield to 13 per cent), buoyed\\nnot only by Mr. Grant\\'s comments but also by the fact that all the buyers\\nwho paid using instalment receipts paid their second instalment of $4 on\\nNov. 10. CP has said it plans to buy more units, adding to its 33-per-cent\\nstake.\\n\\n\\nMr. Grant notes in his newsletter that another former critic of the trust\\n-- namely Richard Rooney, president of Toronto-based money manager\\nBurgundy Asset Management -- has also changed his mind to some extent.\\nLast year, Mr. Rooney wrote a scathing indictment of the trust phenomenon\\nand in fact singled out Legacy. But he told Mr. Grant that a yield of 12\\nto 15 per cent made him far more inclined to recommend investing in the\\nunits now.\\n\\n\\nAs for the Alberta connection in all this, Mr. Charlton says he has been\\none of Mr. Grant\\'s contacts for almost a decade, ever since a mutual\\nfriend in New York said they shared a certain perspective on the market.\\n\"Over the years I\\'ve done some background research for him on various\\nthings, whether it\\'s Ontario Hydro, or crude oil or the Canadian dollar.\"\\n\\n\\nHaving built his investment firm into a 60-person company with branches\\nin Calgary, Grande Prairie, Edmonton and Fort McMurray -- an expansion\\nstrategy he admits now was probably a mistake -- Mr. Charlton is now back\\nwhere he began. He sold the firm to Canadian Western Bank earlier this\\nyear, and now runs a small boutique that specializes in private\\nplacements.\\n\\n\\nAlthough Mr. Charlton says he has great respect for Mr. Grant, who he\\ndescribes as \"an individualistic thinker with a brilliant mind,\" that\\ndoesn\\'t mean the two agree on everything. \"Sometimes we disagree violently\\n-- we have for years on crude oil, for example. He\\'s a great bull and I\\'ve\\nbeen a great bear, but we\\'ve agreed to disagree on that one.\"\\n\\n\\nBusiness West readers can reach Mathew Ingram by fax at (403) 244-9809 or\\nby E-mail at\\nmingram@globeandmail.ca', 'CO': 'leghot : Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust', 'IN': 'i85 : Real Estate Transactions | icre : Construction/Real Estate', 'NS': 'ncat : Content Types | nedc : Commentary/Opinion', 'RE': 'caab : Alberta | cana : Canada | namz : North America | usa : United States | use : Northeast U.S. | usny : New York', 'IPC': 'LGY', 'IPD': 'Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust  | James Grant', 'AN': 'Document glob000020011205dubj01pup'}, {'company_code': 'leghot', 'news_code': 'sfglob', 'date': '1998', 'CLM': 'INVESTMENT NEWS', 'SE': 'Report on Business', 'HD': 'Legacy Hotels', 'WC': '59 words', 'PD': '12 November 1998', 'SN': 'The Globe and Mail', 'SC': 'GLOB', 'ED': 'Metro', 'PG': 'B26', 'LA': 'English', 'CY': 'All material copyright Thomson Canada Limited or its licensors.

Last month, falling business prompted the REIT to announced that it would suspend distributions for the second consecutive quarter.', 'TD': 'Mr. Labatte would not speculate on when investors might see their next distribution cheque, but he did say that traditionally the hotel chain gets an idea of its business levels in the second quarter.  \\n\"We won\\'t be paying distributions until we get a clear view of the business,\" he said in an interview. When payments do resume, Legacy will hand out less than its total distributable profit, leaving an unspecified percentage in reserve.  \\nLegacy reported that profit fell to $17.5-million in the most recent quarter from $37.5-million during the same time last year. For the first nine months of the year, profit was $780,000, down from $47.5-million during the same time a year earlier.  \\nRevenue for the third quarter was $189-million, down from $194-million a year earlier.  \\nRevenue per available room — a benchmark in the industry — tumbled by 30 per cent at both Toronto\\'s Royal York and the Château Frontenac in Quebec City in the third quarter.

Legacy attributed the drop to lower occupancy levels and rates.  \\nEBITDA, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, was $48.2-million, down from $61.2-million a year earlier.  \\nShares of Legacy closed yesterday on the Toronto Stock Exchange at $6.39, off 1 cent.  \\nAlso yesterday, Legacy released the details of its recent purchase of two U.S. properties, one in Washington, D.C., and the other in Seattle.

Year to date, the REIT universe in Canada is down 14 per cent, she said. “When interest rates rise, REITs tend to fall because investors have alternate investments to go to, such as government bonds,” she added.  \\nMichael Smith, an analyst at National Bank Financial Inc., said he also expects the second-quarter results to show a “material bounce back from an unusually hard-hit quarter last year.”  \\nUnits of Legacy rose 5 cents to close at $6.95 on the Toronto Stock Exchange.\", 'CO': 'leghot : Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust', 'IN': 'i81502 : Trusts/Funds/Financial Vehicles | i8150206 : Investment Trusts/Funds | i815020602 : Real Estate Investment Trusts | i6651 : Hotels (except Casino)/Motels | ireest : Real Estate | i66 : Hotels/Restaurants/Casinos | i665 : Lodgings | icre : Construction/Real Estate | iinv : Investing/Securities', 'NS': 'c151 : Earnings | c1512 : Dividends | ccat : Corporate/Industrial News | c15 : Performance', 'RE': 'cana : Canada | namz : North America', 'IPD': 'travel industry  | hotels  | investments  | stocks  | ROB 1000  | $LGY.UN  | Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust', 'PUB': 'Bell Globemedia Interactive', 'AN': 'Document GLOB000020040615e06f0003i'}, {'company_code': 'leghot', 'news_code': 'sfglob', 'date': '2004', 'CLM': 'REAL ESTATE', 'SE': 'Report on Business: Canadian', 'HD': 'Fairmont to reduce stake in Legacy; New accounting rules prompting sale of trust units', 'BY': 'RICHARD BLOOM', 'WC': '488 words', 'PD': '28 April 2004', 'SN': 'The Globe and Mail', 'SC': 'GLOB', 'PG': 'B7', 'LA': 'English', 'CY': 'All material copyright Bell Globemedia Publishing Inc. or its licensors.

Legacy is also based in Toronto.', 'TD': \"Since Legacy's creation in 1997, Fairmont has accounted for its stake on an equity basis. Under new Canadian accounting rules that come into effect next year, Fairmont will have to account for Legacy's financial results on its balance sheet. Those same rules went into effect in the United States this year.  \\nFairmont does not have to include Legacy's results should it reduce its stake to below 25-per-cent, it said.  \\n“Fairmont believes that consolidating Legacy would complicate investors' ability to assess Fairmont's financial performance,” Legacy said in a statement.  \\nAny sale would be “subject to favourable market conditions,” the companies said.  \\nHowever, conditions for interest-rate-sensitive income trust units have been anything but favourable in recent weeks. The sector has taken a beating amid signs of improving economic conditions across North America and fears that inflation may soon climb. Rising inflation and, in turn, increasing interest rates make holding trusts less attractive, because investors can get higher rates of return on a variety of other investment vehicles.  \\nAnalysts, meanwhile, were generally positive about the possible sale. Deutsche Bank's Marc Falcone said consolidating Legacy into Fairmont's results would “unduly distort” Fairmont's financial performance and attractiveness as an investment.  \\nGoldman Sachs analyst Steven Kent agreed, saying “the close relationship between the two . . . has always caused concern with investors who questioned whether or not some of the asset dispositions were arm's-length transactions.”  \\nThe announcements came alongside weaker first-quarter results at Fairmont, which posted a loss of nearly $600,000 (U.S.) or 1 cent a share, compared with a profit of $12.5-million or 16 cents a year earlier. Sales rose slightly to $168.2-million from $167.9-million.  \\nThe news also followed an April 20 announcement from Legacy that it may sell parts of its hotel portfolio. It said it is considering unloading some of its non-core assets, such as its Delta hotels in Canada, possibly this year. That prospect was cheered by some analysts, who were encouraged that Legacy was taking a “more disciplined” approach to its finances.  \\nThe Fairmont Royal York and Fairmont Le Château Frontenac, two landmark hotels, are not expected to be part of that sale.  \\nUnits of Legacy dipped 10 cents to $7.07 on the Toronto Stock Exchange yesterday while Fairmont shares dropped $1.50 to close at $34.75.\", 'ART': 'Illustration', 'CO': 'farmnt : Fairmont Hotels & Resorts Inc | leghot : Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust', 'IN': 'i665 : Lodgings | i6651 : Hotels (except Casino)/Motels | i8150206 : Investment Trusts/Funds | ireest : Real Estate | i66 : Hotels/Restaurants/Casinos | i81502 : Trusts/Funds/Financial Vehicles | i815020602 : Real Estate Investment Trusts | icre : Construction/Real Estate | iinv : Investing/Securities', 'NS': 'ccat : Corporate/Industrial News', 'RE': 'cana : Canada | namz : North America', 'IPD': 'income trusts  | ROB 1000  | $FHR  | $LGY.UN  | Fairmont Hotels &  | Resorts Inc.  | Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust', 'PUB': 'Bell Globemedia Interactive', 'AN': 'Document GLOB000020040428e04s0004e'}, {'company_code': 'leghot', 'news_code': 'sfglob', 'date': '2004', 'SE': 'Business', 'HD': 'Fairmont slumps to loss', 'BY': 'ROMA LUCIW', 'WC': '380 words', 'PD': '27 April 2004', 'SN': 'Breaking News from globeandmail.com', 'SC': 'GMBN', 'LA': 'English', 'CY': 'All material copyright Bell Globemedia Publishing Inc. or its licensors.

Fairmont saw its EBIDTA fall as its real estate activities were down $8-million, partly as a result of a onetime gain a year ago. Its equity investment earnings, from Legacy Hotels, fell $7-million.  \\nThe outbreak of the SARS virus early last year slammed tourism in Canada, and particularly in Toronto, and has been weighing on Fairmont\\'s results.  \\nIn addition, Hurricane Fabian damaged two Fairmont properties in Bermuda. One hotel is closed for repairs until the spring while the other is operational. The company said the damage not covered by insurance is $9-million, of which $1.6-million was recorded in the fourth quarter and the rest in third. (That total is down from an earlier estimate of $10-million to $12-million.)  \\nFourth-quarter operating revenues rose 9.2 to $137.1-million from $125.6-million, boosted by the recent acquisitions of The Fairmont Copley Plaza in Boston and The Fairmont Orchid in Hawaii.  \\nOperating revenues from managed and franchised properties rose 9.5 per cent to $144.9-million from $132.3-million.  \\n“While the appreciation in the Canadian dollar was a key driver of increased revenues, it had a considerable impact on expenses in the fourth quarter,” Fairmont said.  \\nRevenue per available room -- an important measure of profitability for hotel operators -- rose 8.8 per cent at hotels owned by Fairmont. At the hotels it manages, revenue per available room rose 5 per cent. Fairmont said RevPAR continued to improve over year-earlier levels at all of its properties.  \\nOccupancy levels fell 1.3 per cent at both its owned and managed hotels.  \\nFairmont operates more than 80 hotels under the Fairmont and Delta banners, including the landmark former CP Hotels owned by Legacy.  \\nFor the full year, Fairmont earned $50.7-million or 64 cents, down 45 per cent from $92.5-million or $1.18 in 2002. Sales were $658.8-million, up from $590.6-million.  \\nMr. Fatt was optimistic that Fairmont\\'s properties would recover in 2004. “We continue to be encouraged by a number of positive signs that point to a recovery this year.”  \\nHe estimates that full-year profit would range from $65-million and $71-million and per share earnings between 82 cents and 90 cents.

During the third quarter, the company bought back two million shares at a rate of 50,000 a day. It also has been clear about its intentions to sell its hotel properties, which include some one-of-a-kind locations, such as the Banff Springs and Jasper Park Lodge.  \\nBut there is a general feeling on the Street that Fairmont's efforts have been too little and too late.  \\nMr. Icahn is not known for his patience — or for low-key tactics. Last spring, he blasted the top brass at Blockbuster Inc. — another of his investment targets — on the company's own conference call. The operator disconnected him after six minutes of fireworks, heard by hundreds of analysts and investors.  \\nHe has used his take-no-prisoners tactics with several target companies, muscling onto corporate boards and forcing firms to spend millions buying shares.  \\nAt Time Warner Inc., were he holds a small stake, he took on management in a letter to shareholders last month, even taking a swipe at what he described as the “lavish features” of a new employee cafeteria.  \\nMichael Smith, an analyst with National Bank Financial, said he has no doubt Mr. Icahn's investment will force Mr. Fatt to shift gears. “He has got to move faster.”  \\nCanadian fund managers reached yesterday were generally supportive of the route Mr. Fatt has taken, but said they'd be pleased if Mr. Icahn's actions allowed them to realize returns sooner.  \\n“We're comfortable with the management,” said Ted Macklin, portfolio manager at Guardian Capital. “Do we want to be patient?

Last month,  Dundee REIT agreed to sell two-thirds of its properties to a division of  General Electric Co. for $1.5-billion.   \\nThe past two years have also seen the takeovers of Summit REIT by a division of  ING Groep NV, O&Y REIT by a group led by  Brookfield Properties Corp., and Retirement Residences REIT by the  Public Sector Pension Investment Board.\\nIn order to partly fund its acquisition, InnVest said it will sell $200-million in subscription receipts to a syndicate of underwriters led by  RBC Dominion Securities Inc. and  Scotia Capital Inc., on a bought-deal basis.   \\nThe subscription receipts are exchangeable on a one-for-one basis for units of InnVest upon completion of the take-over bid for Legacy.   \\nGlobe and Mail Update\", 'CO': 'cdpq : Caisse de Depot et Placement du Quebec | leghot : Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust', 'IN': 'i81502 : Trusts/Funds/Financial Vehicles | i8150206 : Investment Trusts/Funds | i815020602 : Real Estate Investment Trusts | icre : Construction/Real Estate | iinv : Investing/Securities | ireest : Real Estate | i831 : Financial Investments | i83107 : Portfolio/Fund/Asset Management', 'NS': 'npag : Page-One Story | ncat : Content Types', 'RE': 'cana : Canada | caon : Ontario | namz : North America', 'IPD': 'Caisse | nabs | Legacy', 'PUB': 'The Globe and Mail Division of Bell Globemedia Publishing Inc.', 'AN': 'Document GMBN000020070713e37c00001'}, {'company_code': 'leghot', 'news_code': 'sfglob', 'date': '2007', 'CLM': 'REAL ESTATE', 'SE': 'Report on Business: Globe Investor Markets', 'HD': 'Opening bids leave Legacy shareholders reconsidering options', 'BY': 'LORI McLEOD', 'CR': 'REAL ESTATE REPORTER', 'WC': '541 words', 'PD': '20 June 2007', 'SN': 'The Globe and Mail', 'SC': 'GLOB', 'LA': 'English', 'CY': '2007 CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc.

The question now is what they want to do with their units.', 'TD': \"“My gut is that you had an entirely new shareholder base enter the stock once it announced it was pursuing strategic alternatives,” said one hedge fund manager. “Several U.S. hedge funds and other non-dedicated real estate funds entered. There were expectations as high as a possible $17 bid. Now having suffered a loss, I don't think this is an attractive [arbitrage situation] for anyone. Hence, the massive volume traded.”   \\nLegacy plunged Monday after the luxury hotel owner said offers were coming in at about $2.4-billion, as much as $580-million below expectations.   \\nA $12.60-a-unit offer would put Legacy's enterprise value at about $2.4-billion, while a $17-a-unit offer would have valued it at about $2.98-billion. The units rose 16 cents to $12.45 yesterday, suggesting some doubt about a deal emerging at $12.60.   \\nSome analysts are recommending that unitholders turn down such an offer.   \\n“We believe that offers for the REIT in the $12.60 range do not reflect enough of a premium for unitholders to give up the future earnings growth potential of Legacy and that the best plan of action at this time is the continuation of the current business plan,” Canaccord Adams analysts Jonathan Kelcher and John Travaglini stated in a report.   \\nHowever, others believe a motivated seller and buyers mean the deal will go through. Legacy and other Canadian hotel REITs are facing the end of their tax-exempt status in 2011, and their assets are highly prized by buyers including private equity and pension funds.   \\nThe Ontario Municipal Employees Pension Fund purchased seven Fairmont hotels last year, for example, and is seen as a potential bidder for Legacy. Recent media reports have also suggested Tel Aviv-based real estate investor  Gazit-Globe Ltd. and privately held North American hotel owner Westmont Hospitality Group could be among those interested in Legacy.   \\nReal estate analysts have cited Legacy's “cumbersome” long-term management contracts with its largest shareholder, Fairmont Hotels and Resorts Inc., as part of the drag on its sale value. Macroeconomic factors, particularly the 0.60-percentage-point increase in bond yields since Legacy put itself up for sale on March 1, may also have put downward pressure on the price.   \\n“Looking forward, we believe elevated bond yields could shorten the REIT M&A window of opportunity, although anecdotal evidence suggests demand for high-quality hotel real estate remains relatively sound,” Mario Saric, an analyst at Scotia Capital, said in a research note. “Despite a strategic review process which has potentially yielded less robust results than had been previously expected, we continue to believe a portfolio sale remains more likely than not.”\", 'ART': 'Illustration', 'CO': 'leghot : Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust', 'IN': 'i81502 : Trusts/Funds/Financial Vehicles | i6651 : Hotels (except Casino)/Motels | ireest : Real Estate | i66 : Hotels/Restaurants/Casinos | i665 : Lodgings | icre : Construction/Real Estate | iinv : Investing/Securities | ilea : Leisure/Arts | itourm : Tourism | i8150206 : Investment Trusts/Funds | i815020602 : Real Estate Investment Trusts', 'NS': 'ccat : Corporate/Industrial News', 'RE': 'cana : Canada | namz : North America', 'IPD': 'real estate | investment trusts | investments | ROB 1000 | $LGY.UN | Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust', 'PUB': 'The Globe and Mail Division of Bell Globemedia Publishing Inc.', 'AN': 'Document GLOB000020070620e36k00055'}, {'company_code': 'leghot', 'news_code': 'sfglob', 'date': '2007', 'CLM': 'REAL ESTATE', 'SE': 'Report on Business: Canadian', 'HD': 'Legacy bids fall short, unit price retreats', 'BY': 'LORI McLEOD', 'CR': 'REAL ESTATE REPORTER', 'WC': '370 words', 'PD': '19 June 2007', 'SN': 'The Globe and Mail', 'SC': 'GLOB', 'LA': 'English', 'CY': '2007 CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc.

All rights reserved.', 'LP': 'Calgary -- James Grant is one of Wall Street\\'s best-known \"bears,\" a\\nthoughtful but pessimistic watcher of markets who has found very little\\nworth buying over the past few years. In general, he says he still has a\\nhard time finding bargains, but he did take the time to single one out\\nrecently: the Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust, run by Canadian\\nPacific.\\n\\n\\nIn fact, when asked during a recent interview in The New York Times what\\nhe felt was worth buying, Mr. Grant mentioned just three things --\\nsmall-capitalization Asian stocks, gold and the Legacy REIT. He called it\\n\"a real estate investment trust with a bunch of lovely properties\" that\\nyou could buy \"for about half of book value, with a yield in the low\\nteens.\"', 'TD': 'The comments from Mr. Grant, a veteran U.S. market analyst, boosted the\\nprice of the trust units substantially. What makes his opinion even more\\ninteresting is that a year ago, when the Legacy trust was first\\nestablished, Mr. Grant was still extremely critical of the whole income\\ntrust phenomenon, which he felt was overpromoted in an almost\\nirresponsible way.\\n\\n\\nThere\\'s another interesting aspect to the recommendation of Legacy by Mr.\\nGrant, which appeared in more detail in a recent issue of his widely read\\nGrant\\'s Interest Rate Observer newsletter. Legacy was first brought to his\\nattention by long-time collaborator and fellow bear, Calgary-based\\nmerchant banker Charles (Chuck) Charlton.\\n\\n\\nMr. Charlton, who has run a boutique investment banking firm in Alberta\\nsince 1980, was also critical of the income trust frenzy when it exploded\\nlast year. In fact, it was at his urging that Mr. Grant made a speech at a\\nCanadian financial analysts\\' conference attacking the way trusts were\\nbeing marketed to retail investors by pushing high rates of return.\\n\\n\\n\"I thought it was disgusting the way the corporate finance and\\nunderwriting community was promoting these things, and I called it to his\\nattention,\" Mr. Charlton says. \"So I think he was kind of surprised when I\\ncalled him about Legacy and suggested he have a look at it.\" In his\\nOctober newsletter, Mr. Grant gives Mr. Charlton credit for drawing his\\nattention to the REIT.\\n\\n\\nIn his commentary, Mr. Grant says \"the search for a safe and sane high\\nyield\" in North America \"resembles the search for a vacant parking spot on\\nthe streets of midtown Manhattan: If you find it, there must be something\\nwrong with it.\" Attracted by Legacy\\'s high yield of about 14 per cent, Mr.\\nGrant says he \"tried to find out what\\'s wrong with it.\"\\n\\n\\nHowever, after reviewing the portfolio -- which includes some of CP\\'s\\nbest executive hotels (although not the crown jewels, such as Banff\\nSprings) -- and going over the trust\\'s balance sheet, Mr. Grant comes as\\nclose as he ever does to a \"buy\" rating, saying \"we have arrived at a\\nbullish conclusion: The potential upside outweighs the likely downside.\"\\n\\n\\nAt their price at the time of $5.90, the units -- issued at $9 -- were\\ntrading for half the trust\\'s book value, with a yield of 16 per cent. The\\nunits have since risen to $7 (dropping the yield to 13 per cent), buoyed\\nnot only by Mr. Grant\\'s comments but also by the fact that all the buyers\\nwho paid using instalment receipts paid their second instalment of $4 on\\nNov. 10. CP has said it plans to buy more units, adding to its 33-per-cent\\nstake.\\n\\n\\nMr. Grant notes in his newsletter that another former critic of the trust\\n-- namely Richard Rooney, president of Toronto-based money manager\\nBurgundy Asset Management -- has also changed his mind to some extent.\\nLast year, Mr. Rooney wrote a scathing indictment of the trust phenomenon\\nand in fact singled out Legacy. But he told Mr. Grant that a yield of 12\\nto 15 per cent made him far more inclined to recommend investing in the\\nunits now.\\n\\n\\nAs for the Alberta connection in all this, Mr. Charlton says he has been\\none of Mr. Grant\\'s contacts for almost a decade, ever since a mutual\\nfriend in New York said they shared a certain perspective on the market.\\n\"Over the years I\\'ve done some background research for him on various\\nthings, whether it\\'s Ontario Hydro, or crude oil or the Canadian dollar.\"\\n\\n\\nHaving built his investment firm into a 60-person company with branches\\nin Calgary, Grande Prairie, Edmonton and Fort McMurray -- an expansion\\nstrategy he admits now was probably a mistake -- Mr. Charlton is now back\\nwhere he began. He sold the firm to Canadian Western Bank earlier this\\nyear, and now runs a small boutique that specializes in private\\nplacements.\\n\\n\\nAlthough Mr. Charlton says he has great respect for Mr. Grant, who he\\ndescribes as \"an individualistic thinker with a brilliant mind,\" that\\ndoesn\\'t mean the two agree on everything. \"Sometimes we disagree violently\\n-- we have for years on crude oil, for example. He\\'s a great bull and I\\'ve\\nbeen a great bear, but we\\'ve agreed to disagree on that one.\"\\n\\n\\nBusiness West readers can reach Mathew Ingram by fax at (403) 244-9809 or\\nby E-mail at\\nmingram@globeandmail.ca', 'CO': 'leghot : Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust', 'IN': 'i85 : Real Estate Transactions | icre : Construction/Real Estate', 'NS': 'ncat : Content Types | nedc : Commentary/Opinion', 'RE': 'caab : Alberta | cana : Canada | namz : North America | usa : United States | use : Northeast U.S. | usny : New York', 'IPC': 'LGY', 'IPD': 'Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust  | James Grant', 'AN': 'Document glob000020011205dubj01pup'}, {'company_code': 'leghot', 'news_code': 'sfglob', 'date': '1998', 'CLM': 'INVESTMENT NEWS', 'SE': 'Report on Business', 'HD': 'Legacy Hotels', 'WC': '59 words', 'PD': '12 November 1998', 'SN': 'The Globe and Mail', 'SC': 'GLOB', 'ED': 'Metro', 'PG': 'B26', 'LA': 'English', 'CY': 'All material copyright Thomson Canada Limited or its licensors.

In Tuesday\\'s announcement, Toronto-based Legacy pointed to the devastating toll SARS is taking on hotels and on the overall tourism industry in Canada. \"Severe acute respiratory syndrome continues to have a significant effect on Toronto as well as the Canadian travel industry generally,\" said president and chief executive officer Neil Labatte. Although the company\\'s operating fundamentals are \"sound,\" he said the company\\'s board of trustees felt it was prudent to preserve financial resources. Its last distribution was 18.5 cents a unit. Looking ahead, Legacy said it \"remains cautious\" about its financial performance for the rest of the year.', 'TD': '\"It is difficult to predict the severity of the impact on our portfolio during the important summer months and therefore we remain cautious about our performance for the balance of the year,\" Mr. Labatte said. Legacy owns hotel properties across Canada that are managed by Fairmont Hotels & Resorts Inc. and Delta Hotels Ltd. Its hotels include the swanky Fairmont Empress in Victoria, Fairmont Le Château Frontenac in Quebec, and Fairmont Royal York in Toronto. The company reports its second quarter results on July 22. At that time, Legacy will provide an update on trends and its outlook for the year. Third-quarter distributions will be reviewed in September, the company said. \"We believe that current industry conditions will be short-term in nature and that Legacy is well-positioned to take advantage of a return to more normal business conditions,\" Mr. Labatte added. Units of Legacy slipped 60 cents or more than 10 per cent to $5.20 shortly before 1 p.m. EDT Tuesday. Fairmont stock dropped 7 cents or 2.2 per cent to $31.44.  \\nGlobe and Mail Update', 'CO': 'dltah : Delta Hotels Ltd | farmnt : Fairmont Hotels & Resorts Inc | leghot : Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust', 'IN': 'i665 : Lodgings | i6651 : Hotels (except Casino)/Motels | i66 : Hotels/Restaurants/Casinos | i81502 : Trusts/Funds/Financial Vehicles | i8150206 : Investment Trusts/Funds | i815020602 : Real Estate Investment Trusts | icre : Construction/Real Estate | iinv : Investing/Securities', 'RE': 'cana : Canada | namz : North America', 'IPD': 'legacy  | trust', 'PUB': 'Bell Globemedia Interactive', 'AN': 'Document GMBN000020030618dz6h00004'}, {'company_code': 'leghot', 'news_code': 'sfglob', 'date': '2003', 'HD': 'LEGACY HOTELS REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUST\\nFinancial Snapshot', 'WC': '172 words', 'PD': '17 April 2003', 'SN': 'The Globe and Mail Report on Business Financial Snapshot', 'SC': 'ROBFS', 'LA': 'English', 'CY': 'All material copyright Bell Globemedia Publishing Inc. and its licensors.

Year to date, the REIT universe in Canada is down 14 per cent, she said. “When interest rates rise, REITs tend to fall because investors have alternate investments to go to, such as government bonds,” she added.  \\nMichael Smith, an analyst at National Bank Financial Inc., said he also expects the second-quarter results to show a “material bounce back from an unusually hard-hit quarter last year.”  \\nUnits of Legacy rose 5 cents to close at $6.95 on the Toronto Stock Exchange.\", 'CO': 'leghot : Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust', 'IN': 'i81502 : Trusts/Funds/Financial Vehicles | i8150206 : Investment Trusts/Funds | i815020602 : Real Estate Investment Trusts | i6651 : Hotels (except Casino)/Motels | ireest : Real Estate | i66 : Hotels/Restaurants/Casinos | i665 : Lodgings | icre : Construction/Real Estate | iinv : Investing/Securities', 'NS': 'c151 : Earnings | c1512 : Dividends | ccat : Corporate/Industrial News | c15 : Performance', 'RE': 'cana : Canada | namz : North America', 'IPD': 'travel industry  | hotels  | investments  | stocks  | ROB 1000  | $LGY.UN  | Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust', 'PUB': 'Bell Globemedia Interactive', 'AN': 'Document GLOB000020040615e06f0003i'}, {'company_code': 'leghot', 'news_code': 'sfglob', 'date': '2004', 'CLM': 'REAL ESTATE', 'SE': 'Report on Business: Canadian', 'HD': 'Fairmont to reduce stake in Legacy; New accounting rules prompting sale of trust units', 'BY': 'RICHARD BLOOM', 'WC': '488 words', 'PD': '28 April 2004', 'SN': 'The Globe and Mail', 'SC': 'GLOB', 'PG': 'B7', 'LA': 'English', 'CY': 'All material copyright Bell Globemedia Publishing Inc. or its licensors.

Legacy is also based in Toronto.', 'TD': \"Since Legacy's creation in 1997, Fairmont has accounted for its stake on an equity basis. Under new Canadian accounting rules that come into effect next year, Fairmont will have to account for Legacy's financial results on its balance sheet. Those same rules went into effect in the United States this year.  \\nFairmont does not have to include Legacy's results should it reduce its stake to below 25-per-cent, it said.  \\n“Fairmont believes that consolidating Legacy would complicate investors' ability to assess Fairmont's financial performance,” Legacy said in a statement.  \\nAny sale would be “subject to favourable market conditions,” the companies said.  \\nHowever, conditions for interest-rate-sensitive income trust units have been anything but favourable in recent weeks. The sector has taken a beating amid signs of improving economic conditions across North America and fears that inflation may soon climb. Rising inflation and, in turn, increasing interest rates make holding trusts less attractive, because investors can get higher rates of return on a variety of other investment vehicles.  \\nAnalysts, meanwhile, were generally positive about the possible sale. Deutsche Bank's Marc Falcone said consolidating Legacy into Fairmont's results would “unduly distort” Fairmont's financial performance and attractiveness as an investment.  \\nGoldman Sachs analyst Steven Kent agreed, saying “the close relationship between the two . . . has always caused concern with investors who questioned whether or not some of the asset dispositions were arm's-length transactions.”  \\nThe announcements came alongside weaker first-quarter results at Fairmont, which posted a loss of nearly $600,000 (U.S.) or 1 cent a share, compared with a profit of $12.5-million or 16 cents a year earlier. Sales rose slightly to $168.2-million from $167.9-million.  \\nThe news also followed an April 20 announcement from Legacy that it may sell parts of its hotel portfolio. It said it is considering unloading some of its non-core assets, such as its Delta hotels in Canada, possibly this year. That prospect was cheered by some analysts, who were encouraged that Legacy was taking a “more disciplined” approach to its finances.  \\nThe Fairmont Royal York and Fairmont Le Château Frontenac, two landmark hotels, are not expected to be part of that sale.  \\nUnits of Legacy dipped 10 cents to $7.07 on the Toronto Stock Exchange yesterday while Fairmont shares dropped $1.50 to close at $34.75.\", 'ART': 'Illustration', 'CO': 'farmnt : Fairmont Hotels & Resorts Inc | leghot : Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust', 'IN': 'i665 : Lodgings | i6651 : Hotels (except Casino)/Motels | i8150206 : Investment Trusts/Funds | ireest : Real Estate | i66 : Hotels/Restaurants/Casinos | i81502 : Trusts/Funds/Financial Vehicles | i815020602 : Real Estate Investment Trusts | icre : Construction/Real Estate | iinv : Investing/Securities', 'NS': 'ccat : Corporate/Industrial News', 'RE': 'cana : Canada | namz : North America', 'IPD': 'income trusts  | ROB 1000  | $FHR  | $LGY.UN  | Fairmont Hotels &  | Resorts Inc.  | Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust', 'PUB': 'Bell Globemedia Interactive', 'AN': 'Document GLOB000020040428e04s0004e'}, {'company_code': 'leghot', 'news_code': 'sfglob', 'date': '2004', 'SE': 'Business', 'HD': 'Fairmont slumps to loss', 'BY': 'ROMA LUCIW', 'WC': '380 words', 'PD': '27 April 2004', 'SN': 'Breaking News from globeandmail.com', 'SC': 'GMBN', 'LA': 'English', 'CY': 'All material copyright Bell Globemedia Publishing Inc. or its licensors.

Fairmont saw its EBIDTA fall as its real estate activities were down $8-million, partly as a result of a onetime gain a year ago. Its equity investment earnings, from Legacy Hotels, fell $7-million.  \\nThe outbreak of the SARS virus early last year slammed tourism in Canada, and particularly in Toronto, and has been weighing on Fairmont\\'s results.  \\nIn addition, Hurricane Fabian damaged two Fairmont properties in Bermuda. One hotel is closed for repairs until the spring while the other is operational. The company said the damage not covered by insurance is $9-million, of which $1.6-million was recorded in the fourth quarter and the rest in third. (That total is down from an earlier estimate of $10-million to $12-million.)  \\nFourth-quarter operating revenues rose 9.2 to $137.1-million from $125.6-million, boosted by the recent acquisitions of The Fairmont Copley Plaza in Boston and The Fairmont Orchid in Hawaii.  \\nOperating revenues from managed and franchised properties rose 9.5 per cent to $144.9-million from $132.3-million.  \\n“While the appreciation in the Canadian dollar was a key driver of increased revenues, it had a considerable impact on expenses in the fourth quarter,” Fairmont said.  \\nRevenue per available room -- an important measure of profitability for hotel operators -- rose 8.8 per cent at hotels owned by Fairmont. At the hotels it manages, revenue per available room rose 5 per cent. Fairmont said RevPAR continued to improve over year-earlier levels at all of its properties.  \\nOccupancy levels fell 1.3 per cent at both its owned and managed hotels.  \\nFairmont operates more than 80 hotels under the Fairmont and Delta banners, including the landmark former CP Hotels owned by Legacy.  \\nFor the full year, Fairmont earned $50.7-million or 64 cents, down 45 per cent from $92.5-million or $1.18 in 2002. Sales were $658.8-million, up from $590.6-million.  \\nMr. Fatt was optimistic that Fairmont\\'s properties would recover in 2004. “We continue to be encouraged by a number of positive signs that point to a recovery this year.”  \\nHe estimates that full-year profit would range from $65-million and $71-million and per share earnings between 82 cents and 90 cents.

During the third quarter, the company bought back two million shares at a rate of 50,000 a day. It also has been clear about its intentions to sell its hotel properties, which include some one-of-a-kind locations, such as the Banff Springs and Jasper Park Lodge.  \\nBut there is a general feeling on the Street that Fairmont's efforts have been too little and too late.  \\nMr. Icahn is not known for his patience — or for low-key tactics. Last spring, he blasted the top brass at Blockbuster Inc. — another of his investment targets — on the company's own conference call. The operator disconnected him after six minutes of fireworks, heard by hundreds of analysts and investors.  \\nHe has used his take-no-prisoners tactics with several target companies, muscling onto corporate boards and forcing firms to spend millions buying shares.  \\nAt Time Warner Inc., were he holds a small stake, he took on management in a letter to shareholders last month, even taking a swipe at what he described as the “lavish features” of a new employee cafeteria.  \\nMichael Smith, an analyst with National Bank Financial, said he has no doubt Mr. Icahn's investment will force Mr. Fatt to shift gears. “He has got to move faster.”  \\nCanadian fund managers reached yesterday were generally supportive of the route Mr. Fatt has taken, but said they'd be pleased if Mr. Icahn's actions allowed them to realize returns sooner.  \\n“We're comfortable with the management,” said Ted Macklin, portfolio manager at Guardian Capital. “Do we want to be patient? Yes. But am I disturbed to see Carl Icahn own 9.3 per cent?

Last month,  Dundee REIT agreed to sell two-thirds of its properties to a division of  General Electric Co. for $1.5-billion.   \\nThe past two years have also seen the takeovers of Summit REIT by a division of  ING Groep NV, O&Y REIT by a group led by  Brookfield Properties Corp., and Retirement Residences REIT by the  Public Sector Pension Investment Board.\\nIn order to partly fund its acquisition, InnVest said it will sell $200-million in subscription receipts to a syndicate of underwriters led by  RBC Dominion Securities Inc. and  Scotia Capital Inc., on a bought-deal basis.   \\nThe subscription receipts are exchangeable on a one-for-one basis for units of InnVest upon completion of the take-over bid for Legacy.   \\nGlobe and Mail Update\", 'CO': 'cdpq : Caisse de Depot et Placement du Quebec | leghot : Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust', 'IN': 'i81502 : Trusts/Funds/Financial Vehicles | i8150206 : Investment Trusts/Funds | i815020602 : Real Estate Investment Trusts | icre : Construction/Real Estate | iinv : Investing/Securities | ireest : Real Estate | i831 : Financial Investments | i83107 : Portfolio/Fund/Asset Management', 'NS': 'npag : Page-One Story | ncat : Content Types', 'RE': 'cana : Canada | caon : Ontario | namz : North America', 'IPD': 'Caisse | nabs | Legacy', 'PUB': 'The Globe and Mail Division of Bell Globemedia Publishing Inc.', 'AN': 'Document GMBN000020070713e37c00001'}, {'company_code': 'leghot', 'news_code': 'sfglob', 'date': '2007', 'CLM': 'REAL ESTATE', 'SE': 'Report on Business: Globe Investor Markets', 'HD': 'Opening bids leave Legacy shareholders reconsidering options', 'BY': 'LORI McLEOD', 'CR': 'REAL ESTATE REPORTER', 'WC': '541 words', 'PD': '20 June 2007', 'SN': 'The Globe and Mail', 'SC': 'GLOB', 'LA': 'English', 'CY': '2007 CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc.

The question now is what they want to do with their units.', 'TD': \"“My gut is that you had an entirely new shareholder base enter the stock once it announced it was pursuing strategic alternatives,” said one hedge fund manager. “Several U.S. hedge funds and other non-dedicated real estate funds entered. There were expectations as high as a possible $17 bid. Now having suffered a loss, I don't think this is an attractive [arbitrage situation] for anyone. Hence, the massive volume traded.”   \\nLegacy plunged Monday after the luxury hotel owner said offers were coming in at about $2.4-billion, as much as $580-million below expectations.   \\nA $12.60-a-unit offer would put Legacy's enterprise value at about $2.4-billion, while a $17-a-unit offer would have valued it at about $2.98-billion. The units rose 16 cents to $12.45 yesterday, suggesting some doubt about a deal emerging at $12.60.   \\nSome analysts are recommending that unitholders turn down such an offer.   \\n“We believe that offers for the REIT in the $12.60 range do not reflect enough of a premium for unitholders to give up the future earnings growth potential of Legacy and that the best plan of action at this time is the continuation of the current business plan,” Canaccord Adams analysts Jonathan Kelcher and John Travaglini stated in a report.   \\nHowever, others believe a motivated seller and buyers mean the deal will go through. Legacy and other Canadian hotel REITs are facing the end of their tax-exempt status in 2011, and their assets are highly prized by buyers including private equity and pension funds.   \\nThe Ontario Municipal Employees Pension Fund purchased seven Fairmont hotels last year, for example, and is seen as a potential bidder for Legacy. Recent media reports have also suggested Tel Aviv-based real estate investor  Gazit-Globe Ltd. and privately held North American hotel owner Westmont Hospitality Group could be among those interested in Legacy.   \\nReal estate analysts have cited Legacy's “cumbersome” long-term management contracts with its largest shareholder, Fairmont Hotels and Resorts Inc., as part of the drag on its sale value. Macroeconomic factors, particularly the 0.60-percentage-point increase in bond yields since Legacy put itself up for sale on March 1, may also have put downward pressure on the price.   \\n“Looking forward, we believe elevated bond yields could shorten the REIT M&A window of opportunity, although anecdotal evidence suggests demand for high-quality hotel real estate remains relatively sound,” Mario Saric, an analyst at Scotia Capital, said in a research note. “Despite a strategic review process which has potentially yielded less robust results than had been previously expected, we continue to believe a portfolio sale remains more likely than not.”\", 'ART': 'Illustration', 'CO': 'leghot : Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust', 'IN': 'i81502 : Trusts/Funds/Financial Vehicles | i6651 : Hotels (except Casino)/Motels | ireest : Real Estate | i66 : Hotels/Restaurants/Casinos | i665 : Lodgings | icre : Construction/Real Estate | iinv : Investing/Securities | ilea : Leisure/Arts | itourm : Tourism | i8150206 : Investment Trusts/Funds | i815020602 : Real Estate Investment Trusts', 'NS': 'ccat : Corporate/Industrial News', 'RE': 'cana : Canada | namz : North America', 'IPD': 'real estate | investment trusts | investments | ROB 1000 | $LGY.UN | Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust', 'PUB': 'The Globe and Mail Division of Bell Globemedia Publishing Inc.', 'AN': 'Document GLOB000020070620e36k00055'}, {'company_code': 'leghot', 'news_code': 'sfglob', 'date': '2007', 'CLM': 'REAL ESTATE', 'SE': 'Report on Business: Canadian', 'HD': 'Legacy bids fall short, unit price retreats', 'BY': 'LORI McLEOD', 'CR': 'REAL ESTATE REPORTER', 'WC': '370 words', 'PD': '19 June 2007', 'SN': 'The Globe and Mail', 'SC': 'GLOB', 'LA': 'English', 'CY': '2007 CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc.
