2,leghot,sfglob,1998,ROB Column,Some surprising Legacy lovers,889 words,19 November 1998,The Globe and Mail,GLOB,Metro,B2,English,All material copyright Thomson Canada Limited or its licensors. All rights reserved.,"Calgary -- James Grant is one of Wall Street's best-known ""bears,"" a
thoughtful but pessimistic watcher of markets who has found very little
worth buying over the past few years. In general, he says he still has a
hard time finding bargains, but he did take the time to single one out
recently: the Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust, run by Canadian
Pacific.


In fact, when asked during a recent interview in The New York Times what
he felt was worth buying, Mr. Grant mentioned just three things --
small-capitalization Asian stocks, gold and the Legacy REIT. He called it
""a real estate investment trust with a bunch of lovely properties"" that
you could buy ""for about half of book value, with a yield in the low
teens.""","The comments from Mr. Grant, a veteran U.S. market analyst, boosted the
price of the trust units substantially. What makes his opinion even more
interesting is that a year ago, when the Legacy trust was first
established, Mr. Grant was still extremely critical of the whole income
trust phenomenon, which he felt was overpromoted in an almost
irresponsible way.


There's another interesting aspect to the recommendation of Legacy by Mr.
Grant, which appeared in more detail in a recent issue of his widely read
Grant's Interest Rate Observer newsletter. Legacy was first brought to his
attention by long-time collaborator and fellow bear, Calgary-based
merchant banker Charles (Chuck) Charlton.


Mr. Charlton, who has run a boutique investment banking firm in Alberta
since 1980, was also critical of the income trust frenzy when it exploded
last year. In fact, it was at his urging that Mr. Grant made a speech at a
Canadian financial analysts' conference attacking the way trusts were
being marketed to retail investors by pushing high rates of return.


""I thought it was disgusting the way the corporate finance and
underwriting community was promoting these things, and I called it to his
attention,"" Mr. Charlton says. ""So I think he was kind of surprised when I
called him about Legacy and suggested he have a look at it."" In his
October newsletter, Mr. Grant gives Mr. Charlton credit for drawing his
attention to the REIT.


In his commentary, Mr. Grant says ""the search for a safe and sane high
yield"" in North America ""resembles the search for a vacant parking spot on
the streets of midtown Manhattan: If you find it, there must be something
wrong with it."" Attracted by Legacy's high yield of about 14 per cent, Mr.
Grant says he ""tried to find out what's wrong with it.""


However, after reviewing the portfolio -- which includes some of CP's
best executive hotels (although not the crown jewels, such as Banff
Springs) -- and going over the trust's balance sheet, Mr. Grant comes as
close as he ever does to a ""buy"" rating, saying ""we have arrived at a
bullish conclusion: The potential upside outweighs the likely downside.""


At their price at the time of $5.90, the units -- issued at $9 -- were
trading for half the trust's book value, with a yield of 16 per cent. The
units have since risen to $7 (dropping the yield to 13 per cent), buoyed
not only by Mr. Grant's comments but also by the fact that all the buyers
who paid using instalment receipts paid their second instalment of $4 on
Nov. 10. CP has said it plans to buy more units, adding to its 33-per-cent
stake.


Mr. Grant notes in his newsletter that another former critic of the trust
-- namely Richard Rooney, president of Toronto-based money manager
Burgundy Asset Management -- has also changed his mind to some extent.
Last year, Mr. Rooney wrote a scathing indictment of the trust phenomenon
and in fact singled out Legacy. But he told Mr. Grant that a yield of 12
to 15 per cent made him far more inclined to recommend investing in the
units now.


As for the Alberta connection in all this, Mr. Charlton says he has been
one of Mr. Grant's contacts for almost a decade, ever since a mutual
friend in New York said they shared a certain perspective on the market.
""Over the years I've done some background research for him on various
things, whether it's Ontario Hydro, or crude oil or the Canadian dollar.""


Having built his investment firm into a 60-person company with branches
in Calgary, Grande Prairie, Edmonton and Fort McMurray -- an expansion
strategy he admits now was probably a mistake -- Mr. Charlton is now back
where he began. He sold the firm to Canadian Western Bank earlier this
year, and now runs a small boutique that specializes in private
placements.


Although Mr. Charlton says he has great respect for Mr. Grant, who he
describes as ""an individualistic thinker with a brilliant mind,"" that
doesn't mean the two agree on everything. ""Sometimes we disagree violently
-- we have for years on crude oil, for example. He's a great bull and I've
been a great bear, but we've agreed to disagree on that one.""

American travel market were largely to blame for an increase in
first-quarter losses.


Toronto-based Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust reported a loss
of $15.6-million or 16 cents a unit on sales of $116-million for the first
quarter, compared with a loss of $8.5-million or 7 cents on sales of
$117.7-million in the first quarter of 2001.","Legacy owns 21 hotel properties across Canada that are managed by
Fairmont Hotels & Resorts Inc. and Delta Hotels Ltd.


Company vice-chairman and chief executive officer William Fatt said the
decrease in operating revenue was primarily due to weakness throughout the
North American travel industry.


But he said first-quarter results beat management's initial expectations
and reflects the strength of the company's properties and management.


""Given the current lodging environment, we are especially encouraged by
our portfolio's ability to minimize revenue per available room -- or
RevPAR -- declines to less than 5 per cent,"" Mr. Fatt said.


For the quarter, earnings before interest, taxes and amortization
(EBITDA) fell to $8.1-million from $11.4-million in the previous year. Mr.
Fatt said that increase was largely due to the inclusion of January
results from The Fairmont Empress in Victoria and Fairmont Le Chateau
Frontenac in Quebec, both of which were acquired by Legacy in 2001.


As ""destination"" resorts, those hotels do most of their business in the
second and third quarters, he said.",leghot : Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust,i66 : Hotels/Restaurants/Casinos | i665 : Lodgings | i6651 : Hotels (except Casino)/Motels | i81502 : Trusts/Funds/Financial Vehicles | i8150206 : Investment Trusts/Funds | i815020602 : Real Estate Investment Trusts | icre : Construction/Real Estate | iinv : Investing/Securities,cana : Canada | namz : North America,finance  | financial statements  | ROB 1000  | Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust,Document glob000020020413dy4d0002j,,LGY.UN  | Staff Writer,WENDY STUECK,c15 : Performance | c151 : Earnings | ccat : Corporate/Industrial News | m11 : Equity Markets | mcat : Commodity/Financial Market News,,,,,

All rights reserved.,"A dismal summer tourist season, particularly in Toronto and Quebec City, cut third-quarter profit by more than half, Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust reported yesterday as it told investors it could not predict when distributions to unitholders will resume.  
""Obviously this has been a very difficult year for us,"" Legacy president and chief executive officer Neil Labatte told analysts on a conference call yesterday. ""We saw some pickup in the third quarter but not enough to replace lost business."" Legacy, which owns luxury properties including the landmark former CP hotel chain, said the impact of SARS continued to keep tourists away in the third quarter, traditionally its busiest time of the year. Last month, falling business prompted the REIT to announced that it would suspend distributions for the second consecutive quarter.","Mr. Labatte would not speculate on when investors might see their next distribution cheque, but he did say that traditionally the hotel chain gets an idea of its business levels in the second quarter.  
""We won't be paying distributions until we get a clear view of the business,"" he said in an interview. When payments do resume, Legacy will hand out less than its total distributable profit, leaving an unspecified percentage in reserve.  
Legacy reported that profit fell to $17.5-million in the most recent quarter from $37.5-million during the same time last year. For the first nine months of the year, profit was $780,000, down from $47.5-million during the same time a year earlier.  
Revenue for the third quarter was $189-million, down from $194-million a year earlier.  
Revenue per available room — a benchmark in the industry — tumbled by 30 per cent at both Toronto's Royal York and the Château Frontenac in Quebec City in the third quarter. It was down more than 15 per cent for the entire chain. Legacy attributed the drop to lower occupancy levels and rates.  
EBITDA, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, was $48.2-million, down from $61.2-million a year earlier.  
Shares of Legacy closed yesterday on the Toronto Stock Exchange at $6.39, off 1 cent.  
Also yesterday, Legacy released the details of its recent purchase of two U.S. properties, one in Washington, D.C., and the other in Seattle. Under the terms of those deals, Fairmont Hotels & Resorts Inc., Legacy's major shareholder, has entered into a 40-year management contract to run the properties, Mr. Labatte said.  
As part of the deal, Fairmont also has agreed to pay Legacy $18-million (U.S.) over three years, a move that is common, Mr. Labatte said, when a U.S. hotel is undergoing a brand change. He said the two properties increased expenses for the REIT in the third quarter, but should contribute to results in the second and third quarter of next year. ""Properties like this do not come up every day,"" he said.  
Refinancing commitments reached last week for $335-million also will give the REIT more flexibility by extending and staggering maturities and providing it with more reliable long-term capital, he said.  
Mr. Labatte said activity in the fourth quarter, traditionally the chain's slow time of the year, is in line with other years, except in troubled Toronto and Quebec City.",leghot : Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust,i81502 : Trusts/Funds/Financial Vehicles | i8150206 : Investment Trusts/Funds | i815020602 : Real Estate Investment Trusts | i6651 : Hotels (except Casino)/Motels | i85 : Real Estate Transactions | i66 : Hotels/Restaurants/Casinos | i665 : Lodgings | icre : Construction/Real Estate | iinv : Investing/Securities,cana : Canada | namz : North America,finance  | travel  | tourism  | financial statements  | ROB 1000  | $LGY.UN  | $FHR  | Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust  | Fairmont Hotels &  | Resorts Inc.,Document GLOB000020031021dzal0002u,,,ELIZABETH CHURCH,c151 : Earnings | c1512 : Dividends | gpol : Domestic Politics | gtour : Travel | c15 : Performance | ccat : Corporate/Industrial News | gcat : Political/General News,REAL ESTATE REPORTER,Illustration,Bell Globemedia Interactive,,

All rights reserved.,"Legacy Hotels, the investment trust whose luxury properties include the former CP hotels, yesterday blamed the impact of SARS for its decision to suspend its cash distribution for the second consecutive quarter.   
And some analysts expect a further dry spell as they predict that investors won't see a resumption of the payout from Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust until the second quarter of 2004.","“It's just the cyclicality of the hotel business,” Gail Mifsud, an analyst at Raymond James & Associates, said in an interview. “The first and fourth quarters are traditionally weak quarters. In fact, in the first quarter over the past couple of years, they have reported losses.”   
Investors received 18.5 cents per unit in each of the four quarters prior to the first distribution suspension. At that time, Legacy said a combination of factors ranging from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) to a sluggish U.S. economy and trouble in the airline industry had taken their toll on the hotel business.   
Ms. Mifsud expected Legacy to suspend its third-quarter distribution, saying it makes sense for the trust to do so or it would have had to go to the capital or debt markets to finance its $19.5-million payout.   
Toronto-based Legacy plans to release its third-quarter results on Oct. 20. The analyst expects the investment trust to report profit of 30 cents per unit, down from 40 cents a year earlier.   
Neil Labatte, Legacy's chief executive officer, said he is encouraged by early signs of recovery in the travel industry, but “current earnings continue to be below historical levels, primarily as a result of SARS.”   
Legacy will resume “an appropriate distribution level as soon as operating performance permits,” Mr. Labatte said. “We are cautiously optimistic with the booking pace for 2004 group business. This important customer segment is currently on pace for a strong recovery next year.”   
CIBC World Markets analyst Rossa O'Reilly agreed that a reinstatement of a distribution is unlikely until the second quarter of 2004. “That of course depends on what happens to the economy, travel, and world events between now and then,” he said.   
Mr. O'Reilly said he also had anticipated suspension of the distribution for the latest quarter. “The industry is still in a very weak condition,” he said.   
National Bank Financial Inc. analyst Michael Smith was a bit more optimistic. He said he believes the “most likely” period for a resumption of a distribution would be in the first quarter of 2004, but suggested the amount would be less than 18.5 cents a unit.

The Legacy Hotels income trust, which owns 22 luxury and first-class hotels and resorts in Canada, yesterday reported a large drop in its second-quarter profit, blaming SARS and a weak U.S. economy for diminished hotel revenues.","The Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust also warned that its third-quarter earnings will be “significantly below historical levels” because of continued lower demand in business and leisure travel.   
Legacy said it made $4.7-million or 1 cent per trust unit in the three-month period ended June 30, down substantially from the $25.6-million or 27 cents it made in the 2002 period.   
Revenue dropped 6.4 per cent to $165.8-million, amid lower travel volumes at its properties in major Canadian cities, “most notably in Toronto, as concerns over SARS resulted in a substantial decline in demand,” the trust said.   
Revenues at Legacy's three Toronto hotels decreased about 40 per cent in the second quarter from the prior year.   
“The Canadian lodging industry faced an exceptionally challenging period in the second quarter. The combined impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), recent airline industry problems and a weak U.S. economy created a difficult operating environment,” said Neil Labatte, Legacy's president and chief executive officer. “We have been particularly affected by these events given our significant presence in the Toronto market.”   
The Legacy portfolio includes landmark properties such as Fairmont Le Château Frontenac in Quebec City, the Fairmont Royal York in Toronto and the Fairmont Empress in Vancouver.

27,leghot,sfglob,2003,Report on Business: Canadian,"Legacy Hotels suspends quarterly payout
CEO says income too uncertain in troubled Toronto",1047 words,18 June 2003,The Globe and Mail,GLOB,Metro,B1,English,All material copyright Bell Globemedia Publishing Inc. or its licensors. All rights reserved.,"Legacy Hotels, the investment trust that owns luxury properties including
the landmark former CP Hotels, has taken the drastic step of suspending
distributions to its investors for the quarter, saying its income for the
critical summer months is too tough to call.


""It's hard right now to predict what is going to happen,"" Neil Labatte,
recently appointed chief executive officer of Legacy Hotels Real Estate
Investment Trust, said in an interview yesterday.","He said a combination of factors, including the Toronto outbreak of
severe acute respiratory syndrome, a sluggish U.S. economy, declining
international travel and trouble in the airline industry have all taken
their toll. Under the circumstances, he said the REIT felt it prudent to
cancel distributions altogether, rather than simply reduce them as it did
following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks close to two years ago.


""We just felt that we would take a more conservative strategy, which was
to just not distribute any funds this quarter. I would call it a level of
prudence given the uncertain business volumes for the third quarter.""


Mr. Labatte described the suspension as a reaction to a short-term
disruption.


News of the halt in distributions for the quarter sent units of the real
estate investment trust tumbling more than 10 per cent to a new 12-month
low of $5.21, down from $5.76 in heavy trading on the Toronto Stock
Exchange.


Investment trusts are designed to distribute most of their income to
unitholders and are frequently purchased by investors for their income
stream.


Low interest rates and poor prospects for traditional equities have
prompted an increasing number of investors to enter the trust market.


Given Legacy's large presence in Toronto -- 20 per cent of its rooms are
in the city, with 13 per cent in the massive Royal York Hotel alone --
many observers in the industry were expecting some cut to distributions,
but not a complete suspension.


""That's a bit of a surprise, said TD Newcrest analyst Sam Damiani, who
earlier this month singled out Legacy as the most vulnerable to a
distribution cut of the four hotel REITs that trade on the Toronto Stock
Exchange.


""The income trend has been pretty abysmal,"" he observed in an interview
earlier this month.


Yesterday, he said that based on his estimates, Legacy just did not have
the cash to meet its quarterly distribution level of 18.5 cents a unit.
That adds up to about $19-million based on distributions in the first
quarter. ""A lot of it is money they don't have.""


Mr. Labatte disagreed.


""That would not be a fair assumption. We believe we have the financial
resources to implement our long-term business plan.""


Mr. Labatte did say that Legacy is reviewing its capital projects with
the result that some may be pushed into next year from this fall. He said
he expects regular maintenance programs to continue. ""The thing that we
don't want to do is to pursue a strategy of not investing in our hotels.""


Legacy, which owns 22 hotels in Canada and one in the U.S. lost
$21.4-million in the first quarter, compared with $15.6-million in the
same period last year. The first quarter is traditionally a slow period
for the industry.


The Calgary-based REIT was created close to six years ago to hold the
hotel properties of the former Canadian Pacific empire. Legacy owns the
hotels, but the properties are managed and run by Fairmont Hotels &
Resorts Inc., which holds a 35-per-cent interest in the REIT.


Until recently, Fairmont also provided all the senior executives for
Legacy. Mr. Labatte is the REIT's first internal CEO, although he shares
his time between Legacy and Fairmont. The REIT is currently searching for
its first full-time chief financial officer.


While Legacy is the first REIT to cut distributions because of the
current troubles in the tourism industry, it may not be the last.


In a research note earlier this month, Mr. Damiani at TD Newcrest said
Royal Host REIT, which holds the Canadian master franchise for Travelodge
International Inc., could cut its distributions if demand does not
improve.


A report released yesterday by the Hotel Association of Canada estimates
that tourism spending in Toronto alone has fallen by about $211-million or
more than 30 per cent from last year's levels since the first Canadian
SARS death was reported in early March.


Close to $80-million of that loss was on accommodation spending in
Toronto. ""It's been hit the hardest, no question,"" said Tony Pollard,
president of the Hotel Association of Canada.


Rossa O'Reilly, who follows the real estate industry for CIBC World
Markets, believes all four hotel sector REITs on the TSE are not the place
for a conservative investor, given the current level of uncertainty in the
industry. ""I think you have to view their distributions as high risk.""


Mr. O'Reilly said Legacy, because of its place in the Toronto market, is
the most vulnerable to the problems caused by SARS. ""I think it was the
right thing to do, given the unknown business conditions, to suspend the
distribution.""


An unsettled summer


Six-year-old Legacy Hotels real estate investment trust yesterday
suspended its 18.5 cent distribution to investors for the second quarter,
saying it can't predict what the summer season will be like. Its 23
properties include such landmark hotels as the Fairmont Royal York (above)
and the Fairmont Empress in Victoria, B.c.


THE NUMBERS


-Yield: Q1 -- 12.87%


Q2 -- 0%


-Market cap: $530.23-million


-Revenue: $402.1-million (as of Dec. 31)


-Cash distributions are calculated by taking profit plus depreciation,
and subtracting capital expenditures. That amount is then paid to unit
holders


-Management contracts: Legacy pays Fairmont Hotels & Resorts Inc. a
property management fee of 3 per cent of gross revenues as part of a
50-year deal. It also has a separate administrative service contract, for

In Tuesday's announcement, Toronto-based Legacy pointed to the devastating toll SARS is taking on hotels and on the overall tourism industry in Canada. ""Severe acute respiratory syndrome continues to have a significant effect on Toronto as well as the Canadian travel industry generally,"" said president and chief executive officer Neil Labatte. Although the company's operating fundamentals are ""sound,"" he said the company's board of trustees felt it was prudent to preserve financial resources. Its last distribution was 18.5 cents a unit. Looking ahead, Legacy said it ""remains cautious"" about its financial performance for the rest of the year.","""It is difficult to predict the severity of the impact on our portfolio during the important summer months and therefore we remain cautious about our performance for the balance of the year,"" Mr. Labatte said. Legacy owns hotel properties across Canada that are managed by Fairmont Hotels & Resorts Inc. and Delta Hotels Ltd. Its hotels include the swanky Fairmont Empress in Victoria, Fairmont Le Château Frontenac in Quebec, and Fairmont Royal York in Toronto. The company reports its second quarter results on July 22. At that time, Legacy will provide an update on trends and its outlook for the year. Third-quarter distributions will be reviewed in September, the company said. ""We believe that current industry conditions will be short-term in nature and that Legacy is well-positioned to take advantage of a return to more normal business conditions,"" Mr. Labatte added. Units of Legacy slipped 60 cents or more than 10 per cent to $5.20 shortly before 1 p.m. EDT Tuesday. Fairmont stock dropped 7 cents or 2.2 per cent to $31.44.

All rights reserved.,"Third-quarter profit excluding unusual items at Fairmont Hotels & Resorts Inc. came in below Bay Street forecasts, and the Toronto company is also expecting its fourth-quarter results to come in at the lower end of guidance it gave earlier this year.  
Fairmont yesterday reported profit of 36 cents (U.S.) a share, 4 cents below the analysts' consensus, as fewer U.S. travellers than expected booked into some of the Canadian city centre hotels it manages. As well, it reduced its stake in the Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust, which owns those hotels, to 24 per cent from 35 per cent, reducing its share of the REIT's income. However, Fairmont chief executive officer William Fatt said the Canadian hotels Fairmont owns, including the Fairmont Banff Springs Hotel, above, performed up to expectation, experiencing “a solid rebound” from last year, while results also improved at most of its U.S. and international properties, as occupancy levels and room rates rose.","Final profit for the three months ended Sept. 30 was $131.8-million or $1.66 a share, including a $75.7-million gain on the sale of two hotels and an additional $27.6-million gain on the sale of 12 million of its Legacy units. This compared with just $11.6-million or 15 cents a share a year earlier, after a $7.4-million provision for hurricane damage.  
Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) rose 35.4 per cent to $63.5-million, Fairmont said, while third-quarter revenue was $207.5-million, compared with $188.6-million.  
Final profit for the first nine months of 2004 was $160.2-million or $2.01 a share on revenue of $603.8-million, compared with $64.2-million or 80 cents on revenue of $545.4-million a year earlier.  
Mr. Fatt told analysts in a conference call that Fairmont now expects EBITDA and final profit for this year as a whole to come in at the lower end of its previous guidance of $185-million to $195-million and $160-million to $166-million, respectively.

Toronto-based Fairmont, which operates Legacy REIT's portfolio of 24 hotel properties, said yesterday that the proceeds will come from the sale of 12 million trust units at $6.75 each. The block sale reduces Fairmont's equity investment in Legacy to 23.7 per cent from about 35 per cent.

All rights reserved.,"A recovery in the travel industry has permitted Legacy Hotels REIT to resume its quarterly cash distribution, albeit at a lower amount than when it was suspended a year ago.  
Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust, which holds 24 luxury properties, including Toronto's Fairmont Royal York Hotel, said yesterday that it will pay a second-quarter distribution of 8 cents a unit to shareholders of record as of June 30.","The payout was 18.5 cents a unit last June, when the REIT suspended distributions as the travel sector was hurt by the SARS outbreak and the sluggish economy.  
Legacy has decided to start paying distributions at a “conservative and sustainable level,” and use the balance of its cash to pay down debt, said Neil Labatte, president and chief executive officer of Toronto-based Legacy.  
A payout is possible again because the performance of Legacy's hotels is back in line with the “reasonably good growth” attained in 2002 with “a slight increase in revenues,” Mr. Labatte said in an interview.  
Legacy is seeing strong corporate and group tour demand so far this year, but the outlook is not clear for leisure travellers, who tend to book closer to travel time, he said. “What we are waiting for, and are optimistic about, is the summer leisure business, which comes from the United States and internationally.”  
Gail Mifsud, an analyst at Raymond James & Associates, said the reinstated distribution is below her estimate of 10 cents a unit, but noted that management's conservative approach is “financially prudent” given recent wild swings in Legacy's earnings.  
Ms. Mifsud expects that Legacy's second-quarter results, to be released on July 20, will come in “significantly higher” than the year-earlier period, but she does not believe the rebound in the travel sector will be as sharp as the company initially expected.  
“Legacy depends on international travellers — particularly U.S. travellers,” she said. “With the Canadian-U.S. dollar exchange being rather unfavourable [to Americans], that may dim the results.”  
Ms. Mifsud, who rates Legacy “underperform,” expects real estate investment trusts to continue to face downward pricing pressure owing to the likelihood of interest rate hikes. Year to date, the REIT universe in Canada is down 14 per cent, she said. “When interest rates rise, REITs tend to fall because investors have alternate investments to go to, such as government bonds,” she added.  
Michael Smith, an analyst at National Bank Financial Inc., said he also expects the second-quarter results to show a “material bounce back from an unusually hard-hit quarter last year.”

36,leghot,sfglob,2004,Report on Business: Canadian,Fairmont to reduce stake in Legacy; New accounting rules prompting sale of trust units,488 words,28 April 2004,The Globe and Mail,GLOB,,B7,English,All material copyright Bell Globemedia Publishing Inc. or its licensors. All rights reserved.,"Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust and its largest owner, Fairmont Hotels & Resorts Inc., said yesterday that accounting issues may force Fairmont to reduce its stake in Legacy some time this year.  
Legacy — which owns 24 hotels, the bulk of which are in Canada —is 35 per cent owned by Toronto-based Fairmont, which manages all of its properties. Legacy is also based in Toronto.","Since Legacy's creation in 1997, Fairmont has accounted for its stake on an equity basis. Under new Canadian accounting rules that come into effect next year, Fairmont will have to account for Legacy's financial results on its balance sheet. Those same rules went into effect in the United States this year.  
Fairmont does not have to include Legacy's results should it reduce its stake to below 25-per-cent, it said.  
“Fairmont believes that consolidating Legacy would complicate investors' ability to assess Fairmont's financial performance,” Legacy said in a statement.  
Any sale would be “subject to favourable market conditions,” the companies said.  
However, conditions for interest-rate-sensitive income trust units have been anything but favourable in recent weeks. The sector has taken a beating amid signs of improving economic conditions across North America and fears that inflation may soon climb. Rising inflation and, in turn, increasing interest rates make holding trusts less attractive, because investors can get higher rates of return on a variety of other investment vehicles.  
Analysts, meanwhile, were generally positive about the possible sale. Deutsche Bank's Marc Falcone said consolidating Legacy into Fairmont's results would “unduly distort” Fairmont's financial performance and attractiveness as an investment.  
Goldman Sachs analyst Steven Kent agreed, saying “the close relationship between the two . . . has always caused concern with investors who questioned whether or not some of the asset dispositions were arm's-length transactions.”  
The announcements came alongside weaker first-quarter results at Fairmont, which posted a loss of nearly $600,000 (U.S.) or 1 cent a share, compared with a profit of $12.5-million or 16 cents a year earlier. Sales rose slightly to $168.2-million from $167.9-million.  
The news also followed an April 20 announcement from Legacy that it may sell parts of its hotel portfolio. It said it is considering unloading some of its non-core assets, such as its Delta hotels in Canada, possibly this year. That prospect was cheered by some analysts, who were encouraged that Legacy was taking a “more disciplined” approach to its finances.  
The Fairmont Royal York and Fairmont Le Château Frontenac, two landmark hotels, are not expected to be part of that sale.  
Units of Legacy dipped 10 cents to $7.07 on the Toronto Stock Exchange yesterday while Fairmont shares dropped $1.50 to close at $34.75.",farmnt : Fairmont Hotels & Resorts Inc | leghot : Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust,i665 : Lodgings | i6651 : Hotels (except Casino)/Motels | i8150206 : Investment Trusts/Funds | ireest : Real Estate | i66 : Hotels/Restaurants/Casinos | i81502 : Trusts/Funds/Financial Vehicles | i815020602 : Real Estate Investment Trusts | icre : Construction/Real Estate | iinv : Investing/Securities,cana : Canada | namz : North America,income trusts  | ROB 1000  | $FHR  | $LGY.UN  | Fairmont Hotels &  | Resorts Inc.  | Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust,Document GLOB000020040428e04s0004e,REAL ESTATE,,RICHARD BLOOM,ccat : Corporate/Industrial News,,Illustration,Bell Globemedia Interactive,,

All rights reserved.,"Fairmont Hotels & Resorts Inc. posted a first-quarter loss Tuesday and said it may reduce its investment in Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust.  
Fairmont said Tuesday it has advised Legacy “that it may, subject to favourable market conditions, reduce its Legacy investment during 2004, pursuant to one or several transactions.”","Toronto-based Fairmont, a luxury hotel operator formerly known as Canadian Pacific Hotels, owns 35 per cent of Legacy.  
Fairmont said Tuesday it could reduce its equity investment in Legacy to under 25 per cent, a move that would make it easier to deal with new accounting rules and would allow investors to more easily assess Fairmont's financial performance.  
“As the largest owner of Fairmont and Delta properties, we also believe that the mutually beneficial relationship between ourselves and FHR will continue regardless of a reduction in FHR's equity position in the Trust,” said Neil Labatte, the chief executive officer of Legacy.  
For the three months ended in March, Fairmont said it lost $600,000 (U.S.) or a penny a share, compared with a profit of $12.5-million or 16 cents a year ago.  
Sales climbed 11 per cent to $155.4-million from $140.4-million. But sales from real estate operations fell to $3.3-million from $18.9-million a year ago.  
“We are encouraged by the solid recovery in industry fundamentals leading to travel demand increases throughout the United States,” said William Fatt, Fairmont's company's chief executive officer. “Our overall results met our expectations for the first quarter, which is traditionally one of the company's lowest earnings periods.”  
Revenue per available room — an important measure of profitability for hotel operators — rose 12.9 per cent at hotels owned by Fairmont. At the hotels it manages, revenue per available room rose 12.4 per cent.  
Fairmont said occupancy rates at its U.S. and international hotels improved, with most of these properties also reporting increases in average daily rates.  
Overall occupancy levels rose to 64.7 per cent in the first quarter from 60.8 per cent.  
The hotel operator said the rise of the Canadian dollar offset the decline in Canadian operating sales and higher expenses.

Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust, owner of 24 luxury hotels in Canada and the United States, adopted an optimistic outlook for its key summer period yesterday and said it may also sell parts of its hotel portfolio.","Legacy is considering taking advantage of attractive market conditions to unload some of its non-core assets, such as the Delta hotels in Canada, possibly this year.  
“As a result of low interest rates and a significant amount of capital in the marketplace today, values are reasonably high and people are therefore trying to take advantage of that,” Legacy chief executive officer Neil Labatte said in a conference call.  
“We're looking within our portfolio to see whether this is not an opportune time to sell off some of the non-core assets.”  
Mr. Labatte said any sale would be limited to a “few select properties” and the landmark Canadian railway hotels, such as the Banff Springs or Toronto's Royal York, would likely not be put on the auction block.  
“It's a higher probability that the Deltas would be part of this portfolio that we'd be looking at rather than the Fairmonts,” he said, adding the historic railway hotels were “the cornerstone of Legacy's portfolio.”  
Legacy's hotels are managed by Fairmont Hotels and Resorts , which owns a 35-per-cent stake in Legacy. Legacy has 11 Delta hotels across Canada.  
Legacy units were flat at $7.30 on the Toronto Stock Exchange yesterday afternoon. The units have moved in a yearly range of $7.60 to $5.  
Legacy said group business bookings were ahead of levels seen at the same time last year and, while it was still early, it was optimistic it would see a recovery in its key summer leisure and tour business. Mr. Labatte said limited new hotel growth in Canada and the United States, coupled with more travel activity, should boost its earnings recovery this year.

All rights reserved.,"Fairmont Hotels & Resorts Inc. reported a fourth-quarter loss in a difficult year that saw a hurricane in Bermuda and the SARS outbreak, but said that demand is slowly firming.  
The company said much of the decline in the latest quarter was as a result of higher hotel management expenses, a loss from its investment in Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust and weaker real estate income.","“2003 proved to be one of the most difficult years for the company given the number of challenges we faced, particularly the hurricane damage in Bermuda and the impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome,” said William Fatt, Fairmont's chief executive officer.  
“Despite these external factors, improving industry fundamentals in the third quarter led to improved demand trends in the fourth quarter.”  
Toronto-based Fairmont lost $13.5-million (U.S.) or 17 cents a share in the three months ended in December, compared with a year-earlier profit of $11-million or 14 cents a share.  
On an operating basis, the company earned $9.9-million, down from $32.8-million.  
Those results include charges of $1.6-million or 2 cents a share linked to hurricane damage in Bermuda. Fairmont saw its EBIDTA fall as its real estate activities were down $8-million, partly as a result of a onetime gain a year ago. Its equity investment earnings, from Legacy Hotels, fell $7-million.  
The outbreak of the SARS virus early last year slammed tourism in Canada, and particularly in Toronto, and has been weighing on Fairmont's results.  
In addition, Hurricane Fabian damaged two Fairmont properties in Bermuda. One hotel is closed for repairs until the spring while the other is operational. The company said the damage not covered by insurance is $9-million, of which $1.6-million was recorded in the fourth quarter and the rest in third. (That total is down from an earlier estimate of $10-million to $12-million.)  
Fourth-quarter operating revenues rose 9.2 to $137.1-million from $125.6-million, boosted by the recent acquisitions of The Fairmont Copley Plaza in Boston and The Fairmont Orchid in Hawaii.  
Operating revenues from managed and franchised properties rose 9.5 per cent to $144.9-million from $132.3-million.  
“While the appreciation in the Canadian dollar was a key driver of increased revenues, it had a considerable impact on expenses in the fourth quarter,” Fairmont said.  
Revenue per available room -- an important measure of profitability for hotel operators -- rose 8.8 per cent at hotels owned by Fairmont. At the hotels it manages, revenue per available room rose 5 per cent. Fairmont said RevPAR continued to improve over year-earlier levels at all of its properties.  
Occupancy levels fell 1.3 per cent at both its owned and managed hotels.  
Fairmont operates more than 80 hotels under the Fairmont and Delta banners, including the landmark former CP Hotels owned by Legacy.  
For the full year, Fairmont earned $50.7-million or 64 cents, down 45 per cent from $92.5-million or $1.18 in 2002. Sales were $658.8-million, up from $590.6-million.  
Mr. Fatt was optimistic that Fairmont's properties would recover in 2004. “We continue to be encouraged by a number of positive signs that point to a recovery this year.”  
He estimates that full-year profit would range from $65-million and $71-million and per share earnings between 82 cents and 90 cents. Operating profit would come in between $210-million and $220-million, including approximately $9-million from real estate activities.  
""Despite the numerous challenges the company faced in 2003, we made significant progress during the year in building brand strength and capabilities,” Mr. Fatt said. “In 2004, we intend to add two to four hotels to the Fairmont portfolio.""

All rights reserved.,"Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust ended the year and the fourth quarter in the red, reporting a $9.2-million loss in the final quarter of 2003 and an $8.4-million loss for the year.  
""I am pleased to be able to close the book on 2003,"" Legacy chief executive officer Neil Labatte said in a conference call.","The owner of such landmark properties as the former CP hotels, saw its international business decimated last year in the face of the SARS crisis, a weak U.S. economy and disruptions in the airline industry.  
Mr. Labatte said he expects Legacy properties this year will match 2002 occupancy levels and rates will be flat or show a ""modest ""increase from 2002. He also suggested that distributions to unit holders, suspended in the second quarter of last year, will not be resumed in the near future.  
The first quarter is traditionally the weakest period for the hotel owner, he said, and required it to borrow funds to pay out distributions.  
When distributions resume, he indicated that Legacy intends to hold on to a portion of its earnings.  
Units of the hotel trust closed down 5 cents at $7.30 yesterday on the Toronto Stock Exchange.  
For the fourth quarter, revenue increased 11.6 per cent to $178.9-million, largely because of the addition of two new properties to the trust's portfolio, the firm reported. While market conditions improved generally , Mr. Labatte said Legacy continued to see some areas of weakness, especially in the Quebec City and Toronto markets.  
A $9.8-million charge related to the refinancing of long-term debt contributed to the trust's fourth-quarter loss.  
For the year, revenue increased 2.5 per cent to $663.9-million, with the chain's recent acquisitions contributing $89-million to that total compared with $14.2-million a year earlier.",leghot : Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust,i665 : Lodgings | i81502 : Trusts/Funds/Financial Vehicles | i8150206 : Investment Trusts/Funds | i815020602 : Real Estate Investment Trusts | i6651 : Hotels (except Casino)/Motels | ireest : Real Estate | i66 : Hotels/Restaurants/Casinos | icre : Construction/Real Estate | iinv : Investing/Securities,cana : Canada | namz : North America,financial statements  | ROB 1000  | $LGY.UN  | Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust,Document GLOB000020040128e01s0004f,,,ELIZABETH CHURCH,c151 : Earnings | ccat : Corporate/Industrial News | gpol : Domestic Politics | c15 : Performance | gcat : Political/General News,REAL ESTATE REPORTER,,Bell Globemedia Interactive,,
44,leghot,sfglob,2004,Business,Legacy posts another loss,559 words,27 January 2004,Breaking News from globeandmail.com,GMBN,,,English,All material copyright Bell Globemedia Publishing Inc. or its licensors. All rights reserved.,"Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust posted another quarterly loss Tuesday as the hangover from SARS, troubles in the airline industry and a feeble U.S. economic recovery continued to dissuade tourists from travelling to Canadian destinations, specifically Toronto and Quebec City.  
The Toronto-based trust, which operates 22 luxury and first-class hotels and resorts in Canada and two in the United States, said it sees signs of improvement and is optimistic that 2004 will bring a strong rebound in the lodging industry. But it failed to reinstate the dividend and did not provide a date as to when payments will begin again.","“This last year was undoubtedly one of the most difficult years in the Canadian hotel industry. Much of our reduced performance resulted from external factors, including a weak U.S. economy, airline industry problems, and most notably, the considerable impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome,” said Neil Labatte, Legacy's President and Chief Executive Officer.  
“Despite the challenging operating environment, improving demand trends continued to build through the fourth quarter.”  
For the three months ended in December, Legacy lost $9.2-million or 12 cents a share, compared with a year-earlier profit of $7.6-million or 4 cents a share.  
Fourth-quarter sales edged higher by 11.6 per cent to $178.9-million from $160.3-million, boosted by results from the Fairmont Washington in D.C. and August's acquisition of the Fairmont Olympic Hotel in Seattle, which contributed $23.5-million.  
Legacy owns hotel properties mostly across Canada that are managed by Fairmont Hotels & Resorts Inc. and Delta Hotels Ltd. Its hotels include the swanky Fairmont Empress in Victoria, Fairmont Le Château Frontenac in Quebec, and Fairmont Royal York in Toronto.  
During the quarter, conditions in Quebec City and Toronto were a “challenge,” Legacy said. Sales at Le Château Frontenac were down 15 per cent from 2002 levels because of “softness in the U.S.” and weal international tour levels.  
Sales at Legacy's three Toronto hotels were down 5 per cent from year-earlier levels, but still showed significant improvement over the prior two quarters, Legacy said.  
Occupancies in the city have largely returned to 2002 levels, however, rates within the market remain under pressure, the trust added.  
Canada's tourism industry was battered in 2003 and has been slow to recover after the SARS outbreak early in the year. Legacy, which suspended its distribution payments in the second quarter, has blamed the continuing effects of SARS on the industry for its struggling financial performance throughout the year.  
On Tuesday that trust said only that its “objective continues to be to provide our unit holders with an appropriate level of distributions as soon as operating performance permits.""  
For fiscal 2003, Legacy lost $8.4-million or 21 cents a share on sales of $663.9-million. That compared with a profit of $55.1-million or 50 cents a share on revenues of $647.6-million in 2002.  
Looking ahead, Legacy said it was optimistic that tourism would bounce back this year. “The fourth quarter is traditionally a lower earnings period for Legacy, however, we are encouraged by the improving trends, which point to the anticipated strong recovery in the lodging sector in 2004,” said Mr. Labatte.

46,leghot,sfglob,2005,Report on Business: Canadian,Investors check in to Fairmont Hotels; Icahn's move sends shares to 52-week high,573 words,9 November 2005,The Globe and Mail,GLOB,,B3,English,All material copyright Bell Globemedia Publishing Inc. or its licensors. All rights reserved.,"Where Carl Icahn goes, others follow.  
The news that the billionaire investor has set his money-making sights on Canada's Fairmont Hotels & Resorts Inc. was enough to set off a major U.S. buying spree yesterday on shares of the luxury hotel chain.","The high-profile corporate raider revealed late Monday that he has spent $185-million (U.S.) to acquire a 9.3-per-cent stake in the Toronto-based company, which he considers undervalued. He aims to squeeze out value with measures such as asset sales and stock buybacks.  
Yesterday, Fairmont shares hit a 52-week high of $36.29 in New York where volume reached 3.6 million shares — nearly 10 times the annual daily average.  
Canadians' reaction was more low key, with shares closing at $43 (Canadian), up $1.10 on higher-than-usual volume.  
Mr. Icahn's actions also prompted some analysts to raise stock targets and rating on Fairmont and its sister Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust, figuring his arrival will raise the stock.  
This could be a nasty wakeup call for Fairmont chief executive officer William Fatt and his blue-chip board.  
A meeting “within the next week or two,” is in the works, company spokeswomen Denise Achonu confirmed yesterday. The time and place of that encounter is still up in the air, she said.  
Ms. Achonu said Fairmont executives met yesterday with advisers, including lawyers and investment bankers.  
Mr. Fatt responded to Mr. Icahn's arrival at Fairmont by saying many of the objectives he laid out are in the works. During the third quarter, the company bought back two million shares at a rate of 50,000 a day. It also has been clear about its intentions to sell its hotel properties, which include some one-of-a-kind locations, such as the Banff Springs and Jasper Park Lodge.  
But there is a general feeling on the Street that Fairmont's efforts have been too little and too late.  
Mr. Icahn is not known for his patience — or for low-key tactics. Last spring, he blasted the top brass at Blockbuster Inc. — another of his investment targets — on the company's own conference call. The operator disconnected him after six minutes of fireworks, heard by hundreds of analysts and investors.  
He has used his take-no-prisoners tactics with several target companies, muscling onto corporate boards and forcing firms to spend millions buying shares.  
At Time Warner Inc., were he holds a small stake, he took on management in a letter to shareholders last month, even taking a swipe at what he described as the “lavish features” of a new employee cafeteria.  
Michael Smith, an analyst with National Bank Financial, said he has no doubt Mr. Icahn's investment will force Mr. Fatt to shift gears. “He has got to move faster.”  
Canadian fund managers reached yesterday were generally supportive of the route Mr. Fatt has taken, but said they'd be pleased if Mr. Icahn's actions allowed them to realize returns sooner.  
“We're comfortable with the management,” said Ted Macklin, portfolio manager at Guardian Capital. “Do we want to be patient? Yes. But am I disturbed to see Carl Icahn own 9.3 per cent? No, I'm not disturbed by that.”",farmnt : Fairmont Hotels & Resorts Inc | leghot : Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust,i665 : Lodgings | i6651 : Hotels (except Casino)/Motels | ireest : Real Estate | i66 : Hotels/Restaurants/Casinos | i81502 : Trusts/Funds/Financial Vehicles | i8150206 : Investment Trusts/Funds | i815020602 : Real Estate Investment Trusts | icre : Construction/Real Estate | iinv : Investing/Securities,cana : Canada | usa : United States | caon : Ontario | namz : North America,stocks  | Carl Icahn  | ROB 1000  | $FHR  | $LGY.UN  | Fairmont Hotels &  | Resorts Inc.  | Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust,Document GLOB000020051109e1b90001r,HOTELS,,ELIZABETH CHURCH,ccat : Corporate/Industrial News,REAL ESTATE REPORTER,Illustration,Bell Globemedia Interactive,,

50,leghot,sfglob,2005,Report on Business: Money & Markets,"Hershey, Coke among throng of profit reports",502 words,21 July 2005,The Globe and Mail,GLOB,,B16,English,All material copyright Bell Globemedia Publishing Inc. or its licensors. All rights reserved.,"Two products central to the American diet — cola and chocolate bars — are on the menu today as companies serve up a full helping of second-quarter earnings.  
More than 50 companies will open their books, including two iconic U.S. consumer product brands, Coca-Cola Co. and Hershey Co. In Canada, the earnings lineup features Shell Canada Ltd., Nova Chemicals Corp., TransAlta Corp., Zarlink Semiconductor Inc., Norbord Inc. and Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust.","At Coke, shareholders are hoping for a repeat of the first quarter, when the world's biggest soft-drink maker beat estimates. But analysts aren't expecting any dramatic improvements from the company, whose shares have languished for years as it suffered a series of miscues that left the door open to rival PepsiCo Inc.  
Coke is fighting back with more aggressive marketing and advertising, but its efforts will take time to bear fruit, analysts say.  
“While Coke's strategies are clearly long term in nature . . . continued weak volume growth and market share declines could push the stock price even lower than today's level,” A.G. Edwards & Sons Inc. analyst Jeffrey Clark said in a note to clients.  
Coke is expected to report share profit of 64 cents (U.S.) — flat with a year earlier, according to the median estimate of 16 analysts surveyed by Thomson First Call. Revenue is seen rising 6 per cent, to $6.34-billion from $5.96-billion.  
Wall Street has higher expectations for Hershey, whose second-quarter profit is expected to climb 15 per cent, to 38 cents from 33 cents a year earlier. Revenue is seen rising 8 per cent, to $962-million from $894-million.  
Analysts cite the impact of new products, price increases and supply-chain efficiencies that are boosting operating margins at the candy maker, whose brands include Hershey's, Reese's, Kit Kat and Jolly Rancher.  
“We see nothing to upset Hershey's business momentum over the near term,” said Legg Mason analyst George Askew. But with the stock trading at about 23 times estimated 2006 earnings, he thinks the shares are fully valued.  
However, Hershey's stock could get a pop if it, like many others, tops forecasts. With 128 of 500 S&P companies reporting as of yesterday morning, 94 have exceeded estimates, 17 have matched and 17 have fallen short. On the S&P/TSX, four have topped estimates, one has matched and three have missed.  
Rosy U.S. data expected  
In keeping with U.S. Federal Reserve Board chairman Alan Greenspan's upbeat assessment of the economy yesterday, today's economic numbers are expected to paint an encouraging picture.  
Reports include initial jobless claims for the week ended July 16, the leading indicator for June and the Philadelphia fed Index for July.

The one-time charge, reported by the REIT in its second-quarter results, also suggests Fairmont's sale of selected hotel properties is nearly complete, Mr. Jain said.

The deal, the latest move in a wave of consolidation in the property trust sector, amounts to $12.60 a unit, all-cash agreement – a 20-per-cent premium over Legacy's 30-day average trading price on the Toronto Stock Exchange on Feb. 28.","That was the day before Legacy put itself into play, striking a special committee to explore strategic alternatives.

The deal is for a portfolio of 25 hotels across Canada and in two U.S. cities, operating under the Fairmont and Delta brands. The portfolio will be broken up and distributed between two groups of the investing partners.

59,leghot,sfglob,2007,Report on Business: Globe Investor Markets,Opening bids leave Legacy shareholders reconsidering options,541 words,20 June 2007,The Globe and Mail,GLOB,,,English,2007 CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc. All Rights Reserved.,"Now that  Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust has received preliminary offers for about $12.60 a share, analysts and investors are wrestling with what this means for the trust.   
Ownership of the units has likely changed greatly since the company announced a strategic review, leaving an unknown amount with hedge funds and arbitrage traders. The question now is what they want to do with their units.","“My gut is that you had an entirely new shareholder base enter the stock once it announced it was pursuing strategic alternatives,” said one hedge fund manager. “Several U.S. hedge funds and other non-dedicated real estate funds entered. There were expectations as high as a possible $17 bid. Now having suffered a loss, I don't think this is an attractive [arbitrage situation] for anyone. Hence, the massive volume traded.”   
Legacy plunged Monday after the luxury hotel owner said offers were coming in at about $2.4-billion, as much as $580-million below expectations.   
A $12.60-a-unit offer would put Legacy's enterprise value at about $2.4-billion, while a $17-a-unit offer would have valued it at about $2.98-billion. The units rose 16 cents to $12.45 yesterday, suggesting some doubt about a deal emerging at $12.60.   
Some analysts are recommending that unitholders turn down such an offer.   
“We believe that offers for the REIT in the $12.60 range do not reflect enough of a premium for unitholders to give up the future earnings growth potential of Legacy and that the best plan of action at this time is the continuation of the current business plan,” Canaccord Adams analysts Jonathan Kelcher and John Travaglini stated in a report.   
However, others believe a motivated seller and buyers mean the deal will go through. Legacy and other Canadian hotel REITs are facing the end of their tax-exempt status in 2011, and their assets are highly prized by buyers including private equity and pension funds.   
The Ontario Municipal Employees Pension Fund purchased seven Fairmont hotels last year, for example, and is seen as a potential bidder for Legacy. Recent media reports have also suggested Tel Aviv-based real estate investor  Gazit-Globe Ltd. and privately held North American hotel owner Westmont Hospitality Group could be among those interested in Legacy.   
Real estate analysts have cited Legacy's “cumbersome” long-term management contracts with its largest shareholder, Fairmont Hotels and Resorts Inc., as part of the drag on its sale value. Macroeconomic factors, particularly the 0.60-percentage-point increase in bond yields since Legacy put itself up for sale on March 1, may also have put downward pressure on the price.   
“Looking forward, we believe elevated bond yields could shorten the REIT M&A window of opportunity, although anecdotal evidence suggests demand for high-quality hotel real estate remains relatively sound,” Mario Saric, an analyst at Scotia Capital, said in a research note. “Despite a strategic review process which has potentially yielded less robust results than had been previously expected, we continue to believe a portfolio sale remains more likely than not.”",leghot : Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust,i81502 : Trusts/Funds/Financial Vehicles | i6651 : Hotels (except Casino)/Motels | ireest : Real Estate | i66 : Hotels/Restaurants/Casinos | i665 : Lodgings | icre : Construction/Real Estate | iinv : Investing/Securities | ilea : Leisure/Arts | itourm : Tourism | i8150206 : Investment Trusts/Funds | i815020602 : Real Estate Investment Trusts,cana : Canada | namz : North America,real estate | investment trusts | investments | ROB 1000 | $LGY.UN | Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust,Document GLOB000020070620e36k00055,REAL ESTATE,,LORI McLEOD,ccat : Corporate/Industrial News,REAL ESTATE REPORTER,Illustration,The Globe and Mail Division of Bell Globemedia Publishing Inc.,,

All Rights Reserved.,"Units of Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust dropped 16 per cent from a record close on Friday after the company said it had received preliminary takeover offers at a value that fell shy of investors' expectations.   
Units of the trust, which owns 25 North American luxury hotels including the Fairmont Royal York in Toronto, have risen steadily since Legacy announced March 1 it was up for sale.","The units had risen as high as $15 mid-session on Friday and fell sharply after the company said that preliminary bids were falling in the $12.60 range.   
Legacy put out the news in a release after its units were halted following a request by the Toronto Stock Exchange for an update of its strategic review, which is being led by Morgan Stanley and RBC Dominion Securities Inc.   
An offer of $12.60 a unit would value Legacy's equity at approximately $1.5-billion.   
At that bid price, its enterprise value, which includes debt and preferred shares, and excludes cash, would be $2.4-billion, according to National Bank Financial analyst Jimmy Shan.   
In a research note on May 4, another National Bank Financial analyst, Michael Smith, raised concerns the units were trading well above a realistic bid price, which he had put in the range of $12.50 to $13 a unit.   
“I feared this would happen, and that people were not accounting for the negative value of Legacy's management contract with Fairmont,” Mr. Smith said in an interview.   
Fairmont Hotels and Resorts Inc., which was taken private last year by Prince al-Waleed bin Talal and Colony Capital LLC, is Legacy's largest shareholder and has long-term management contracts for 13 of its properties.   
If Fairmont renegotiated the terms of these “generous” contracts, it could add $1 to $2 a unit to Legacy's takeover price, Mr. Smith said.   
Legacy has said there is no guarantee a binding offer will be made, and that it is continuing to review its alternatives.

All Rights Reserved.,"Morgan Stanley, the second-largest securities firm in the world, has had some trouble lately keeping track of its Canadian investments.   
The Wall Street investment bank disclosed this week that it has “inadvertently” failed to file notice with Canadian regulators that it holds more than a 10-per-cent interest in three Canadian companies, two of which are currently in play.","The companies in question are Sunrise Senior Living Real Estate Investment Trust, Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust and Torstar Corp.   
In one instance, the failure to report has spanned several years. In the case of Torstar, Morgan Stanley Investment Management Inc. disclosed that it has exceeded the 10-per-cent threshold for disclosure of an investment since April 29, 2005. As of this week, it holds or has control over 10.59 per cent of Torstar class B shares, it said.   
It also revealed that it holds an 11.51-per-cent stake in Legacy REIT and passed the 10-per-cent mark in January of this year. Legacy announced a strategic review earlier this year and is involved in a bidding process.   
In the case of Sunrise, Morgan Stanley has close to a 13-per-cent interest and has held more than 10 per cent since May, 2006.   
In all cases, Morgan Stanley said the investments were made in the ordinary course of business as passive investments and indicated it is taking steps to fulfill filing requirements.   
A spokeswoman for the investment bank declined to provide any details of how the oversight occurred or how it was discovered.   
But at least one executive at the companies in question said the disclosure came as no surprise to him.   
“It didn't come as a shock at all. As a matter of fact, I was always shocked that they had never reported before,” said Doug MacLatchy, chief executive officer of Sunrise REIT, a Toronto seniors housing company that is the subject of a takeover battle.   
“I knew they were big, I didn't know they were over the 10 [per cent].

64,leghot,sfglob,2007,Report on Business: Canadian,Legacy Hotels looks for a buyer; Part of growing list of REITs testing hot property market,715 words,2 March 2007,The Globe and Mail,GLOB,,,English,2007 CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc. All Rights Reserved.,"Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust, owner of landmarks such as Quebec City's Château Frontenac, is scouting for a buyer, adding its name to a growing list of REITs that are testing the waters of the hot property market.   
Legacy, which has a portfolio of 25 properties, said yesterday it has hired investment bankers and formed a special committee of trustees to advise the board on strategic alternatives.","The board has not set a deadline for the review, and has cautioned that it may stick with the status quo as the best value for investors.   
Still, yesterday's move sent the REIT's units climbing to a new high of $13.21 on heavy trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange.   
The action has the support of Legacy's largest shareholder, Fairmont Hotels & Resorts Inc. Fairmont, bought last year by Prince al-Waleed bin Talal and Colony Capital, holds a 22.4-per-cent stake in the REIT and also manages 13 of its properties.   
Legacy has been the subject of takeover talk since Fairmont was bought last year, fuelled in part by the high price hotel properties have attracted and also by the expectation that Fairmont's new owners would want to sell their holdings in the REIT and focus on the hotel management business. Even before yesterday's jump, its units were considered by many analysts to be trading with a takeover premium built into their price.   
Even so, given the amount of money now chasing property deals and the increased interest in the hotel sector, several analysts yesterday said it is hard to say just what price Legacy's portfolio may fetch.   
“Anything can happen in this environment,” said Michael Smith, an analyst who follows the company for National Bank Financial.   
Last year, a record $3-billion in hotel properties traded hands in Canada, up 73 per cent from 2005, according to research from Colliers International Hotels. Among those deals was the $1.5-billion (U.S.) sale of seven hotels to the Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement Board by Fairmont and the sale of Intrawest Corp. to private equity firm Fortress Investment Group.   
This year there is already one major portfolio on the market — five Westin Hotels — that has attracted a wide range of interest, says the company that is marketing that deal.   
Other market observers say the list of potential Legacy portfolio buyers will likely include private equity firms, pension plans and possibly U.S. public companies. The portfolio is expected to attract global interest as an increasing number of institutional players look to gain more exposure to the hotel sector.   
“This is a positive step by management and the board and a positive event for investors,” said Raymond James analyst Gail Mifsud, who has a ‘strong buy' recommendation on the stock.   
Ms. Mifsud said with its downtown locations in major cities, she believes there is “no doubt” that there is underlying value in the company. “The real estate is second to none,” she said.   
Mr. Smith said the 50-year management contracts that the Fairmont hotels in the portfolio carry could be a drawback for some potential buyers. “They are unusually long and generous,” he said.   
As well, he said the hotels run under the Delta banner and the one Sheraton hotel may not attract the same price as those operated under the Fairmont name.   
Others expressed concern Canadian investors may be about to lose yet another major hotel company from the public markets. In the space of one year, Fairmont, Four Seasons Hotels Inc. and Intrawest have all been taken private or are on their way to going there.

65,leghot,sfglob,2007,Business,Legacy REIT on the hunt for buyer,659 words,1 March 2007,The Globe and Mail (Breaking News),GMBN,,,English,2007 CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc. All Rights Reserved.,"Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust, owner of landmarks such as Quebec City's Chateau Frontenac, is scouting for a buyer, adding its name to a growing list of REITs that are testing the waters of the hot property market.  
Legacy, which has a portfolio of 25 properties, said Thursday it has hired investment bankers and formed a special committee of trustees to advise the board on strategic alternatives.","The board has not set a deadline for the review, and has cautioned that it may stick with the status quo as the best value for investors.  
Still, Thursday's move sent the REIT's units soaring to a new high of $13.21 on heavy trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange.  
The action has the support of Legacy's largest shareholder, Fairmont Hotels & Resorts Inc. Fairmont, bought last year by Prince al-Waleed bin Talal and Colony Capital, holds a 22.4-per-cent stake in the REIT and also manages 12 of its properties.  
Legacy has been the subject of takeover talk since Fairmont was bought last year, fuelled in part by the high price hotel properties have attracted and also by the expectation that Fairmont's new owners would want to sell their holdings in the REIT and focus on the hotel management business. Even before Thursday's jump, its units were considered by many analysts to be trading with a takeover premium built into their price.  
Even so, given the amount of money now chasing property deals and the increased interest in the hotel sector, several analysts Thursday said it is hard to say just what price Legacy's portfolio might fetch.  
“Anything can happen in this environment,” said Michael Smith, an analyst who follows the company for National Bank.  
Last year, a record $3-billion in hotel properties traded hands in Canada, up 73 per cent from 2005, according to research from Colliers International Hotels. Among those deals was the blockbuster $1.5-billion (U.S.) sale of seven hotels to the Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement Board by Fairmont and the sale of Intrawest Corp. to private equity firm Fortress Investment Group.  
This year there is already one major portfolio on the market — five Westin Hotels — that has attracted a wide range of interest, says the company that is marketing that deal.  
Other market observers say the list of potential buyers will likely include private equity firms, pension plans and possibly U.S. public companies. The portfolio is expected to attract global interest as an increasing number of institutional players look to gain more exposure to the hotel sector.  
“This is a positive step by management and the board and a positive event for investors, Raymond James analyst Gail Mifsud said, who has a strong buy recommendation on the stock.  
Ms. Mifsud said with its downtown locations in major cities, she believes there is “no doubt” that there is underlying value in the company. “The real estate is second to none,” she said.  
Mr. Smith of National bank said the 50-year management contracts that the Fairmont hotels in the portfolio carry could be a drawback for some potential buyers.  
“They are unusually long and generous,” he said.  
As well, he said the hotels run under the Delta banner and the one Sheraton Hotel may not attract the same price as those operated under the Fairmont name.  
Others expressed concern Canadian investors may be about to lose yet another major hotel company from the public markets. In the space of one year, Fairmont, Four Seasons Hotels & Resorts and Intrawest have all been taken private or are on their way to going there.  
“The big institutions are stealing another great company from the little guy,” one analyst said.  
Legacy has hired Morgan Stanley and RBC Capital Markets as its financial advisers and Blake, Cassels & Graydon as its legal counsel.
